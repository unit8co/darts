Using Torch Models with GPUs and TPUs
=====================================

This section was written for Darts 0.17.0 and later.

We assume that you already know about Torch Forecasting Models in Darts. If you're new to the topic we recommend you to read the `guide on Torch Forecasting Models <https://unit8co.github.io/darts/userguide/torch_forecasting_models.html>`_ first. This guide also contains a section about performance recommendations, which we recommend reading first. Finally, here is also an `Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Model example <https://unit8co.github.io/darts/examples/04-RNN-examples.html>`_\ , on which this section is going to be based on.

Use CPU
-------

By default all models will run on CPU. As shown in the RNN example above, we'll import the Air Passenger dataset, as well as other necessary modules.

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np
   import pandas as pd

   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   from darts.dataprocessing.transformers import Scaler
   from darts.models import RNNModel
   from darts.metrics import mape
   from darts.datasets import AirPassengersDataset

Now we read and scale the data like this:

.. code-block:: python

   # Read data:
   series = AirPassengersDataset().load()
   series = series.astype(np.float32)

   # Create training and validation sets:
   train, val = series.split_after(pd.Timestamp("19590101"))

   # Normalize the time series (note: we avoid fitting the transformer on the validation set)
   transformer = Scaler()
   train_transformed = transformer.fit_transform(train)
   val_transformed = transformer.transform(val)
   series_transformed = transformer.transform(series)

Next we will create our RNN like this:

.. code-block:: python

   my_model = RNNModel(
       model="RNN",
       hidden_dim=20,
       dropout=0,
       batch_size=16,
       n_epochs=300,
       optimizer_kwargs={"lr": 1e-3},
       model_name="Air_RNN",
       log_tensorboard=True,
       random_state=42,
       training_length=20,
       input_chunk_length=14,
       force_reset=True,
   )

and fit it to the data:

.. code-block:: python

   my_model.fit(train_transformed, val_series=val_transformed)

where in the output we can see that no other processing unit is used to train our model:

.. code-block::

   GPU available: False, used: False
   TPU available: False, using: 0 TPU cores
   IPU available: False, using: 0 IPUs

     | Name      | Type    | Params
   --------------------------------------
   0 | criterion | MSELoss | 0     
   1 | rnn       | RNN     | 460   
   2 | V         | Linear  | 21    
   --------------------------------------
   481       Trainable params
   0         Non-trainable params
   481       Total params
   0.004     Total estimated model params size (MB)

   Epoch 299: 100% 8/8 [00:00<00:00, 42.49it/s, loss=0.00285, v_num=logs]
   <darts.models.forecasting.rnn_model.RNNModel at 0x7fc75901cb10>

Now the model is ready to start predicting, which won't be shown here since it's included in the example linked in the start of this guide.

Use a GPU
---------

GPUs can dramatically improve the performance of your model in terms of processing time. By using an Accelerator in the `Pytorch Lightning Trainer <https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/stable/common/trainer.html#accelerator>`_\ , we can enjoy the benefits of a GPU. We only need to instruct our model to use our machine's GPU through PyTorch Lightning Trainer parameters, which are expressed as the ``pl_trainer_kwargs`` dictionary, like this:

.. code-block:: python

   my_model = RNNModel(
       model="RNN",
       ...
       force_reset=True,
       pl_trainer_kwargs={
         "accelerator": "gpu",
         "devices": [0]
       },
   )

which now outputs:

.. code-block::

   GPU available: True, used: True
   TPU available: False, using: 0 TPU cores
   IPU available: False, using: 0 IPUs
   LOCAL_RANK: 0 - CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES: [0]

     | Name      | Type    | Params
   --------------------------------------
   0 | criterion | MSELoss | 0     
   1 | rnn       | RNN     | 460   
   2 | V         | Linear  | 21    
   --------------------------------------
   481       Trainable params
   0         Non-trainable params
   481       Total params
   0.004     Total estimated model params size (MB)

   Epoch 299: 100% 8/8 [00:00<00:00, 39.81it/s, loss=0.00285, v_num=logs]
   <darts.models.forecasting.rnn_model.RNNModel at 0x7ff1b5e4d4d0>

From the output we can see that the GPU is both available and used. The rest of the code doesn't require any change, i.e. it's irrelevant if we are using a GPU or CPU.

Multi GPU support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Darts utilizes `Lightning's multi GPU capabilities <https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/stable/accelerators/gpu_intermediate.html>`_ to be able to capitalize on scalable hardware. 

Multiple parallelization strategies exist for multiple GPU training, which - because of different strategies for multiprocessing and data handling - interact strongly with the execution environment. 

Currently in Darts the ``ddp_spawn`` distribution strategy is tested. 

As per the description of the `Lightning documentation <https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/stable/accelerators/gpu_intermediate.html#distributed-data-parallel-spawn>`_ has some noteworthy limitations, eg. it **can not run** in:


* 
  Jupyter Notebook, Google COLAB, Kaggle, etc.

* 
  In case you have a nested script without a root package

This in practice means, that execution has to happen in a separate ``.py`` script, that has the following general context around the code executing the training:

.. code-block:: python

   import torch

   if __name__ == '__main__':

       torch.multiprocessing.freeze_support()

The **main** pattern is necessary (see `this <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/windows.html#multiprocessing-error-without-if-clause-protection>`_\ ) even when your execution **does not** happen in a windows environment.

Beyond this, no other major modification to your models is necessary other than allowing multi GPU training in the ``pl_trainer_args`` for example like

``pl_trainer_kwargs = {"accelerator": "gpu", "devices": -1, "auto_select_gpus": True}``

This method automatically selects all available GPUs for training. Manual setting of the number of devices is also possible.

The ``ddp`` family of strategies creates indiviual subprocesses for each GPU, so contents of the memory (notably the ``Dataloder``\ ) gets copied over. Thus, as per the `description of lightning docs <https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/stable/accelerators/gpu_intermediate.html#distributed-data-parallel>`_ caution is advised in setting the ``Dataloader(num_workers=N)`` too high, since according to it:

"Dataloader(num_workers=N), where N is large, bottlenecks training with DDP… ie: it will be VERY slow or won’t work at all. This is a PyTorch limitation."

Usage of other distribution strategies with Darts currently *might* very well work, but are yet untested and subject to individual setup / experimentation.   

Use a TPU
---------

Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) is an AI accelerator application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) developed by Google specifically for neural network machine learning.

There are three main ways to get access to a TPU:


* Google Colab
* Google Cloud (GCP)
* Kaggle

If you are using a TPU in the Google Colab kind of notebook, then you should first install these:

.. code-block::

   !pip install cloud-tpu-client==0.10 https://storage.googleapis.com/tpu-pytorch/wheels/torch_xla-1.9-cp37-cp37m-linux_x86_64.whl
   !pip install torch==1.9.0+cu111 torchvision==0.10.0+cu111 torchtext==0.10.0 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu111/torch_stable.html
   !pip install pyyaml==5.4.1

and then instruct our model to use a TPU or more. In our example we are using four TPUs, like this:

.. code-block:: python

   my_model = RNNModel(
       model="RNN",
       ...
       force_reset=True,
       pl_trainer_kwargs={
         "accelerator": "tpu",
         "tpu_cores": [4]
       },
   )

which outputs:

.. code-block::

   WARNING:root:TPU has started up successfully with version pytorch-1.9
   GPU available: False, used: False
   TPU available: True, using: [4] TPU cores
   IPU available: False, using: 0 IPUs

     | Name      | Type    | Params
   --------------------------------------
   0 | criterion | MSELoss | 0     
   1 | rnn       | RNN     | 460   
   2 | V         | Linear  | 21    
   --------------------------------------
   481       Trainable params
   0         Non-trainable params
   481       Total params
   0.002     Total estimated model params size (MB)
   Epoch 299: 100% 8/8 [00:00<00:00, 8.52it/s, loss=0.00285, v_num=logs]
   <darts.models.forecasting.rnn_model.RNNModel at 0x7ff1b5e4d4d0>

From the output we can see that our model is using 4 TPUs.
