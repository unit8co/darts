Quantile Detector
-----------------

Flags anomalies that are beyond some quantiles of historical data.
This is similar to a threshold-based detector, where the thresholds are
computed as quantiles of historical data when the detector is fitted.

        """Quantile Detector

        Flags values that are either below or above the `low_quantile` and `high_quantile` quantiles
        of historical data, respectively.

        If a single value is provided for `low_quantile` or `high_quantile`, this same value will be
        used across all components of the series.

        If sequences of values are given for the parameters `low_quantile` and/or `high_quantile`,
        they must be of the same length, matching the dimensionality of the series passed
        to `fit()`, or have a length of 1. In the latter case, this single value will be used
        across all components of the series.

        If either `low_quantile` or `high_quantile` is None, the corresponding bound will not be used.
        However, at least one of the two must be set.

        Parameters
        ----------
        low_quantile
            (Sequence of) quantile of historical data below which a value is regarded as anomaly.
            Must be between 0 and 1. If a sequence, must match the dimensionality of the series
            this detector is applied to.
        high_quantile
            (Sequence of) quantile of historical data above which a value is regarded as anomaly.
            Must be between 0 and 1. If a sequence, must match the dimensionality of the series
            this detector is applied to.
