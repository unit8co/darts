Filtering Anomaly Model
-----------------------

A `FilteringAnomalyModel` wraps around a Darts filtering model and one or
several anomaly scorer(s) to compute anomaly scores
by comparing how actuals deviate from the model's predictions (filtered series).

        The filtering model may or may not be already fitted. The underlying assumption is that this model
        should be able to adequately filter the series in the absence of anomalies. For this reason,
        it is recommended to either provide a model that has already been fitted and evaluated to work
        appropriately on a series without anomalies, or to ensure that a simple call to the :func:`fit()`
        function of the model will be sufficient to train it to satisfactory performance on series without anomalies.

        Calling :func:`fit()` on the anomaly model will fit the underlying filtering model only
        if `allow_model_training` is set to `True` upon calling `fit()`.
        In addition, calling :func:`fit()` will also fit the fittable scorers, if any.

        Parameters
        ----------
        model
            A Darts `FilteringModel` used to filter the actual time series.
        scorer
            One or multiple scorer(s) used to compare the actual and predicted time series in order to obtain an
            anomaly score `TimeSeries`. If a list of scorers,
            :meth:`~darts.ad.anomaly_model.filtering_am.FilteringAnomalyModel.score` will output anomaly scores for
            each scorer.
