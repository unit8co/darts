        """Abstract class for invertible transformers.

        All the deriving classes have to implement the static methods
        :func:`ts_transform()` and :func:`ts_inverse_transform()`.
        This class takes care of parallelizing the transformation on multiple ``TimeSeries`` when possible.

        Parameters
        ----------
        name
            The data transformer's name
        n_jobs
            The number of jobs to run in parallel. Parallel jobs are created only when a Sequence[TimeSeries] is passed
            as input to a method, parallelising operations regarding different TimeSeries. Defaults to `1` (sequential).
            Setting the parameter to `-1` means using all the available processors.
            Note: for a small amount of data, the parallelisation overhead could end up increasing the total
            required amount of time.
        verbose
            Optionally, whether to print operations progress

        Notes
        -----
        Note: the :func:`ts_transform()` and :func:`ts_inverse_transform()` methods are designed to be
        static methods instead of instance methods to allow an efficient parallelisation also when the
        scaler instance is storing a non-negligible amount of data. Using instance methods would imply
        copying the instance's data through multiple processes, which can easily introduce a bottleneck
        and nullify parallelisation benefits.

        The function must take as first argument a ``TimeSeries`` object, and return the transformed
        ``TimeSeries`` object. Additional parameters can be added if necessary, but in this case,
        :func:`_inverse_transform_iterator()` should be redefined accordingly, to yield the necessary
        arguments to this function (See :func:`_inverse_transform_iterator()` for further details)

        This method is not implemented in the base class and must be implemented in the deriving classes.

        Parameters
        ----------
        series (TimeSeries)
            TimeSeries which will be transformed.

        Additional `args` and `kwargs` from :func:`inverse_transform()` (that don't change across the calls to
        :func:`ts_inverse_transform()`) are already forwarded, and thus don't need to be included in this generator.

        The basic implementation of this method returns ``zip(series)``, i.e., a generator of single-valued tuples,
        each containing one TimeSeries object.

        Parameters
        ----------
        series (Sequence[TimeSeries])
            Sequence of TimeSeries received in input.

        Returns
        -------
        Iterator[Tuple[TimeSeries]]
            An iterator containing tuples of inputs for the :func:`ts_inverse_transform()` method.
