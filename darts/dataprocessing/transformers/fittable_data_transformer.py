        """Base class for fittable transformers.

        All the deriving classes have to implement the static methods
        :func:`ts_transform()` and :func:`ts_fit()`. The fitting and transformation functions must
        be passed during the transformer's initialization. This class takes care of parallelizing
        operations involving multiple ``TimeSeries`` when possible.

        Parameters
        ----------
        name
            The data transformer's name
        n_jobs
            The number of jobs to run in parallel. Parallel jobs are created only when a `Sequence[TimeSeries]` is
            passed as input to a method, parallelising operations regarding different `TimeSeries`. Defaults to `1`
            (sequential). Setting the parameter to `-1` means using all the available processors.
            Note: for a small amount of data, the parallelisation overhead could end up increasing the total
            required amount of time.
        verbose
            Optionally, whether to print operations progress

        Notes
        -----
        The :func:`ts_transform()` and :func:`ts_fit()` methods are designed to be static methods instead of instance
        methods to allow an efficient parallelisation also when the scaler instance is storing a non-negligible
        amount of data. Using instance methods would imply copying the instance's data through multiple processes, which
        can easily introduce a bottleneck and nullify parallelisation benefits.

        """The function that will be applied to each series when :func:`fit` is called.

        The function must take as first argument a ``TimeSeries`` object, and return an object containing information
        regarding the fitting phase (e.g., parameters, or external transformers objects). All these parameters will
        be stored in ``self._fitted_params``, which can be later used during the transformation step.

        This method is not implemented in the base class and must be implemented in the deriving classes.

        If more parameters are added as input in the derived classes, :func:`_fit_iterator()`
        should be redefined accordingly, to yield the necessary arguments to this function (See
        :func:`_fit_iterator()` for further details)

        Parameters
        ----------
        series (TimeSeries)
            `TimeSeries` against which the scaler will be fit.

    def _fit_iterator(

        """
        Return an ``Iterator`` object with tuples of inputs for each single call to :func:`ts_fit()`.
        Additional `args` and `kwargs` from :func:`fit()` (that don't change across the calls to :func:`ts_fit()`)
        are already forwarded, and thus don't need to be included in this generator.

        The basic implementation of this method returns ``zip(series)``, i.e., a generator of single-valued tuples,
        each containing one ``TimeSeries`` object.

        Parameters
        ----------
        series (Sequence[TimeSeries])
            sequence of series received in input.

        Returns
        -------
        Iterator[Tuple[TimeSeries]]
            An iterator containing tuples of inputs for the :func:`ts_fit()` method.
