        """Abstract class for data transformers.

        All the deriving classes have to implement the static method :func:`ts_transform`.
        The class offers the method :func:`transform()`, for applying a transformation to a ``TimeSeries`` or
        ``Sequence[TimeSeries]``. This class takes care of parallelizing the transformation of multiple ``TimeSeries``
        when possible.

        Data transformers requiring to be fit first before calling :func:`transform` should derive
        from :class:`.FittableDataTransformer` instead.
        Data transformers that are invertible should derive from :class:`.InvertibleDataTransformer` instead.

        Note: the :func:`ts_transform` method is designed to be a static method instead of a instance method to allow an
        efficient parallelisation also when the scaler instance is storing a non-negligible amount of data. Using
        an instance method would imply copying the instance's data through multiple processes, which can easily
        introduce a bottleneck and nullify parallelisation benefits.

        Parameters
        ----------
        name
            The data transformer's name
        n_jobs
            The number of jobs to run in parallel. Parallel jobs are created only when a ``Sequence[TimeSeries]``
            is passed as input to a method, parallelising operations regarding different TimeSeries.
            Defaults to `1` (sequential). Setting the parameter to `-1` means using all the available processors.
            Note: for a small amount of data, the parallelisation overhead could end up increasing the total
            required amount of time.

        The function must take as first argument a ``TimeSeries`` object, and return the transformed ``TimeSeries``
        object. If more parameters are added as input in the derived classes, the ``_transform_iterator()`` should be
        redefined accordingly, to yield the necessary arguments to this function (See ``_transform_iterator()`` for
        further details).

        This method is not implemented in the base class and must be implemented in the deriving classes.

        Parameters
        ----------
        series
            series to be transformed.

        Return an ``Iterator`` object with tuples of inputs for each single call to :func:`ts_transform()`.
        Additional `args` and `kwargs` from :func:`transform()` (constant across all the calls to
        :func:`ts_transform()`) are already forwarded, and thus don't need to be included in this generator.

        The basic implementation of this method returns ``zip(series)``, i.e., a generator of single-valued tuples,
        each containing one ``TimeSeries`` object.

        Parameters
        ----------
        series
            Sequence of series received in input.

        -------
