    """
    Determines the optimal alignment between two time series series1 and series2,
    according to the Dynamic Time Warping algorithm.
    The alignment minimizes the distance between pair-wise elements after warping.
    All elements in the two series are matched and are in strictly monotonically increasing order.
    Considers only the values in the series, ignoring the time axis.

    Dynamic Time Warping can be applied to determine how closely two time series correspond,
    irrespective of phase, length or speed differences.

    Parameters
    ----------
    series1
        `TimeSeries`
    series2
        A `TimeSeries`
    window
        Used to constrain the search for the optimal alignment: see SakoeChiba and Itakura.
        Default considers all possible alignments.
    distance
        Function taking as input either two `floats` for univariate series or two `np.ndarray`,
        and returning the distance between them.

        Defaults to the abs difference for univariate-data and the
        sum of the abs difference for multi-variate series.
    multi_grid_radius
        Default radius of -1 results in an exact evaluation of the dynamic time warping algorithm.
        Without constraints DTW runs in O(nxm) time where n,m are the size of the series.
        Exact evaluation with no constraints, will result in a performance warning on large datasets.

        Setting multi_grid_radius to a value other than -1, will enable the approximate multi-grid solver,
        which executes in linear time, vs quadratic time for exact evaluation.
        Increasing radius trades solution accuracy for performance.
