Forecasting Model Explainer Base Class
------------------------------
A forecasting model explainer captures an already fitted forecasting model, and apply an Explainability model
to this forecasting model. Its purpose is to be able to explain each past input contribution to a given model forecast.
This 'explanation' depends on the characteristics of the XAI model chosen (shap, lime etc...).

        Naming:
        - A background time series is a time series with which we 'train' the Explainer model.
        - A foreground time series is the time series we will explain according to the fitted Explainer model.

        Parameters
        ----------
        model
            A ForecastingModel we want to explain. It has to be fitted first.
        background_series
            A TimeSeries or a list of time series we want to use to 'train' with any foreground we want to explain.
            This is optional, for 2 reasons:
                - In general we want to keep the training_series of the model and this is the default one,
                but in case of multiple time series training (global or meta learning) the ForecastingModel doesn't
                save them. In this case we need to feed a background time series.
                - We might want to consider a reduced well chosen background in order to reduce computation
                time.
        background_past_covariates
            A past covariates TimeSeries or list of TimeSeries that the model needs once fitted.
        background_future_covariates
            A future covariates TimeSeries or list of TimeSeries that the model needs once fitted.

        Main method of the ForecastingExplainer class.
        Return a dictionary of dictionaries of (mutivariates) TimeSeries instances
        (or a list of dictionaries of dictionaries, il multiple TimeSeries list):
        - the first dimension corresponds to the horizons we want to explain.
        - the second dimension corresponds to the components of the target time series we want to explain.


        The value of the second dimension dictionary is a (multivariate) TimeSeries instance giving the 'explanation'
        for a given forecast (horizon, target) at any timestamp forecastable corresponding to the foreground
        TimeSeries input.

        The name convention for each component of this multivariate TimeSeries is:
        `name`_`type_of_cov`_lag_`int` where:
        - `name` is the existing name of the component in the original different foreground TimeSeries (target or past
        or future).
        - `type_of_cov` is the type of covariates. It can take 3 different values: `target`, `past`, `future`.
        - `int` is the lag index.

        Example:
        Let's say we have a model with 2 targets (multivariates) named "T_1" and "T_2", three past covariates we didn't
        name and one future covariate we didn't name. Also, horizons = [0, 1].
        The model is a regression model, with lags = 3, lags_past_covariates=[-1, -3], lags_future_covariates = [0]

        We provide a foreground_series (not a list), past covariates, future covariates, of length 5.

        Then the output will be the following:

        output[0]['T_1'] a multivariate TimeSeries containing the 'explanations' of the chosen Explainer, with
        component names:
            - T_0_target_lag-1
            - T_0_target_lag-2
            - T_0_target_lag-3
            - T_1_target_lag-1
            - T_1_target_lag-2
            - T_1_target_lag-3
            - 0_past_cov_lag-1 (we didn't name the past covariate so it took the default name 0)
            - 0_past_cov_lag-3 (we didn't name the past covariate so it took the default name 0)
            - 1_past_cov_lag-1 (we didn't name the past covariate so it took the default name 1)
            - 1_past_cov_lag-3 (we didn't name the past covariate so it took the default name 1)
            - 2_past_cov_lag-1 (we didn't name the past covariate so it took the default name 2)
            - 2_past_cov_lag-3 (we didn't name the past covariate so it took the default name 2)
            - 0_fut_cov_lag_0  (we didn't name the future covariate so it took the default name 0)

        of length 3, as we can explain 5-3+1 forecasts (basically timestamp indexes 4, 5, and 6)


        Parameters
        ----------
        foreground_series
            Optionally, target timeseries we want to explain. Can be multivariate.
            If none is provided, explain will automatically provide the whole background TimeSeries explanation.
        foreground_past_covariates
            Optionally, past covariate timeseries if needed by the ForecastingModel.
        foreground_future_covariates
            Optionally, future covariate timeseries if needed by the ForecastingModel.
        horizons
            Optionally, a list of integer values representing which elements in the future
            we want to explain, starting from the first timestamp prediction at 0.
            For now we consider only models with output_chunk_length and it can't be bigger than output_chunk_length.
        target_names
            Optionally, A list of string naming the target names we want to explain.

        Returns
        -------
        a dictionary of dictionary of Timeseries (or a list of such) of explaining values :
            - each element of the first dimension dictionary is corresponding to a forecast horizon
            - each element of the second dimension dictionary is corresponding to a target name
