    Creates the features array `X` and labels array `y` to train a lagged-variables regression model (e.g. an
    `sklearn` model) when `is_training = True`; alternatively, creates the features array `X` to produce a series
    of prediction from an already-trained regression model when `is_training = False`. In both cases, a list of time
    indices corresponding to each generated observation is also returned.

    Notes
    -----
    Instead of calling `create_lagged_data` directly, it is instead recommended that:
        - `create_lagged_training_data` be called if one wishes to create the `X` and `y` arrays
        to train a regression model.
        - `create_lagged_prediction_data` be called if one wishes to create the `X` array required
        to generate a prediction from an already-trained regression model.
    This is because even though both of these functions are merely wrappers around `create_lagged_data`, their
    call signatures are more easily interpreted than `create_lagged_data`. For example,
    `create_lagged_prediction_data` does not accept `output_chunk_length` nor `multi_models` as inputs, since
    these inputs are not used when constructing prediction data. Similarly, `create_lagged_prediction_data`
    returns only `X` and `times` as outputs, as opposed to returning `y` as `None` along with `X` and `times`.

    The `X` array is constructed from the lagged values of up to three separate timeseries:
        1. The `target_series`, which contains the values we're trying to predict. A regression model that
        uses previous values of the target its predicting is referred to as *auto-regressive*; please refer to
        [1]_ for further details about auto-regressive timeseries models.
        2. The past covariates series, which contains values that are *not* known into the future. Unlike
        the target series, however, past covariates are *not* to be predicted by the regression model.
        3. The future covariates (AKA 'exogenous' covariates) series, which contains values that are known
        into the future, even beyond the data in `target_series` and `past_covariates`.
    See [2]_ for a more detailed discussion about target, past, and future covariates. Conversely, `y` is
    comprised only of the lagged values of `target_series`.

    The shape of `X` is:
        `X.shape = (n_observations, n_lagged_features, n_samples)`,
    where `n_observations` equals either the number of time points shared between all specified series,
    or `max_samples_per_ts`, whichever is smallest.
    The shape of `y` is:
        `y.shape = (n_observations, output_chunk_length, n_samples)`,
    if `multi_models = True`, otherwise:
        `y.shape = (n_observations, 1, n_samples)`.

    Along the `n_lagged_features` axis, `X` has the following structure (for `*_lags=[-2,-1]` and
    `*_series.n_components = 2`):
        lagged_target | lagged_past_covariates | lagged_future_covariates
    where each `lagged_*` has the following structure:
        lag_-2_comp_1_* | lag_-2_comp_2_* | lag_-1_comp_1_* | lag_-1_comp_2_*

    Along the `n_lagged_labels` axis, `y` has the following structure (for `output_chunk_length=4` and
    `target_series.n_components=2`):
        lag_+0_comp_1_target | lag_+0_comp_2_target | ... | lag_+3_comp_1_target | lag_+3_comp_2_target

    The `lags` and `lags_past_covariates` must contain only values less than or equal to -1. In other words, one
    cannot use the value of either of these series at time `t` to predict the value of the target series at the
    same time `t`; this is because the values of `target_series` and `past_covariates` at time `t` aren't available
    at prediction time, by definition. Conversely, since the values of `future_covariates` are known into the future,
    `lags_future_covariates` can contain negative, positive, and/or zero lag values (i.e. we *can* use the values of
    `future_covariates` at time `t` or beyond to predict the value of `target_series` at time `t`).

    The exact method used to construct `X` and `y` depends on whether all of the specified timeseries are
    of the same frequency or not:
        - If all specified timeseries are of the same frequency, `strided_moving_window` is used to extract
        contiguous time blocks from each timeseries; the lagged variables are then extracted from each window.
        - If all specified timeseries are *not* of the same frequency, then `find_shared_times` is first used
        to find those times common to all three timeseries, after which the lagged features are extracted by
        offsetting the time indices of these common times by the requested lags.
    In cases where it can be validly applied, the 'moving window' method is expected to be faster than the
    'intersecting time' method. However, in exceptional cases where only a small number of lags are being
    extracted, but the difference between the lag values is large (e.g. `lags = [-1, -1000]`), the 'moving
    window' method is expected to consume significantly more memory, since it extracts all of the series values
    between the maximum and minimum lags as 'windows', before actually extracting the specific requested lag values.

    In order for the lagged features of a series to be added to `X`, *both* that series and the corresponding lags
    must be specified; if a series is specified without the corresponding lags, that series will be ignored and not
    added to `X`. `X` and `y` arrays are constructed independently over the samples dimension (i.e. the second axis)
    of each series.

    If the provided series are stochastic (i.e. `series.n_components > 1`), then an `X` and `y` array will be
    constructed for each sample; the arrays corresponding to each sample are concatenated togather along the `2`nd
    axis of `X` and `y`. In other words, `create_lagged_data` is vectorised over the sample axis of the `target_series`,
    `past_covariates`, and `future_covariates` inputs. Importantly, if stochastic series are provided, each series must
    have the same number of samples, otherwise an error will be thrown.

    Each series input (i.e. `target_series`, `past_covariates`, and `future_covariates`) can be specified either as
    a single `TimeSeries`, or as a `Sequence` of `TimeSeries`; the specified series must all be of the same type,
    however (i.e. either all `TimeSeries` or all `Sequence[TimeSeries]`). If `Sequence[TimeSeries]` are specified,
    then a feature matrix `X` and labels array `y` will be constructed using the corresponding `TimeSeries` in
    each `Sequence` (i.e. the first `TimeSeries` in each `Sequence` are used to create an `X` and `y`, then
    the second `TimeSeries` in each `Sequence` are used to create an `X` and `y`, etc.). If `concatenate = True`,
    these `X`'s and `y`'s will be concatenated along the `0`th axis; otherwise, a list of `X` and `y` array will
    be returned. Note that `times` is always returned as a `Sequence[pd.Index]`, however, even when
    `concatenate = True`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    target_series
        Optionally, the series for the regression model to predict. Must be specified if `is_training = True`.
        Can be specified as either a `TimeSeries` or as a `Sequence[TimeSeries]`.
    output_chunk_length
        Optionally, the number of timesteps ahead into the future the regression model is to predict. Must
        best specified if `is_training = True`.
    past_covariates
        Optionally, the past covariates series that the regression model will use as inputs. Unlike the
        `target_series`, `past_covariates` are *not* to be predicted by the regression model. Can be
        specified as either a `TimeSeries` or as a `Sequence[TimeSeries]`.
    future_covariates
        Optionally, the future covariates (i.e. exogenous covariates) series that the regression model will
        use as inputs. Can be specified as either a `TimeSeries` or as a `Sequence[TimeSeries]`.
    lags
        Optionally, the lags of the target series to be used as (auto-regressive) features. If not specified,
        auto-regressive features will *not* be added to `X`. Each lag value is assumed to be negative (e.g.
        `lags = [-3, -1]` will extract `target_series` values which are 3 timesteps and 1 timestep away from
        the current value).
    lags_past_covariates
        Optionally, the lags of `past_covariates` to be used as features. Like `lags`, each lag value is assumed to
        be less than or equal to -1.
    lags_future_covariates
        Optionally, the lags of `future_covariates` to be used as features. Unlike `lags` and
        `lags_past_covariates`, `lags_future_covariates` values can be positive (i.e. use values *after* time `t`
        to predict target at time `t`), zero (i.e. use values *at* time `t` to predict target at time `t`), and/or
        negative (i.e. use values *before* time `t` to predict target at time `t`).
    uses_static_covariates
        Whether the model uses/expects static covariates. If `True`, it enforces that static covariates must
        have identical shapes across all target series.
    last_static_covariates_shape
        Optionally, the last observed shape of the static covariates. This is ``None`` before fitting, or when
        `uses_static_covariates` is ``False``.
    max_samples_per_ts
        Optionally, the maximum number of samples to be drawn for training/validation; only the most recent
        samples are kept. In theory, specifying a smaller `max_samples_per_ts` should reduce computation time,
        especially in cases where many observations could be generated.
    multi_models
        Optionally, specifies whether the regression model predicts multiple timesteps into the future. If `True`,
        then the regression model is assumed to predict all of the timesteps from time `t` to `t+output_chunk_length`.
        If `False`, then the regression model is assumed to predict *only* the timestep at `t+output_chunk_length`.
        This input is ignored if `is_training = False`.
    check_inputs
        Optionally, specifies that the `lags_*` and `series_*` inputs should be checked for validity. Should be set
        to `False` if inputs have already been checked for validity (e.g. inside the `__init__` of a class), otherwise
        should be set to `True`.
    use_moving_windows
        Optionally, specifies that the 'moving window' method should be used to construct `X` and `y` if all of the
        provided series are of the same frequency. If `use_moving_windows = False`, the 'time intersection' method
        will always be used, even when all of the provided series are of the same frequency. In general, setting
        to `True` results in faster tabularization at the potential cost of higher memory usage. See Notes for further
        details.
    is_training
        Optionally, specifies whether the constructed lagged data are to be used for training a regression model
        (i.e. `is_training = True`), or for generating predictions from an already-trained regression model (i.e.
        `is_training = False`). If `is_training = True`, `target_series` and `output_chunk_length` must be specified,
        the `multi_models` input is utilised, and a label array `y` is returned. Conversely, if `is_training = False`,
        then `target_series` and `output_chunk_length` do not need to be specified, the `multi_models` input is ignored,
        and the returned `y` value is `None`.
    concatenate
        Optionally, specifies that `X` and `y` should both be returned as single `np.ndarray`s, instead of as
        a `Sequence[np.ndarray]`. If each series input is specified as a `Sequence[TimeSeries]` and
        `concatenate = False`, `X` and `y` will be lists whose `i`th element corresponds to the feature matrix or label
        array formed by the `i`th `TimeSeries` in each `Sequence[TimeSeries]` input. Conversely, if `concatenate = True`
        when `Sequence[TimeSeries]` are provided, then `X` and `y` will be arrays created by concatenating all of the
        feature/label arrays formed by each `TimeSeries` along the `0`th axis. Note that `times` is still returned as
        `Sequence[pd.Index]`, even when `concatenate = True`.

    Returns
    -------
    X
        The constructed features array(s), with shape `(n_observations, n_lagged_features, n_samples)`.
        If the series inputs were specified as `Sequence[TimeSeries]` and `concatenate = False`, then `X`
        is returned as a `Sequence[np.array]`; otherwise, `X` is returned as a single `np.array`.
    y
        The constructed labels array. If `multi_models = True`, then `y` is a
        `(n_observations, output_chunk_length, n_samples)`-shaped array; conversely, if
        `multi_models =  False`, then `y` is a `(n_observations, 1, n_samples)`-shaped array.
        If the series inputs were specified as `Sequence[TimeSeries]` and `concatenate = False`, then `y`
        is returned as a `Sequence[np.array]`; otherwise, `y` is returned as a single `np.array`.
    times
        The `time_index` of each observation in `X` and `y`, returned as a `Sequence` of `pd.Index`es.
        If the series inputs were specified as `Sequence[TimeSeries]`, then the `i`th list element
        gives the times of those observations formed using the `i`th `TimeSeries` object in each
        `Sequence`. Otherwise, if the series inputs were specified as `TimeSeries`, the only
        element is the times of those observations formed from the lone `TimeSeries` inputs.
    last_static_covariates_shape
        The last observed shape of the static covariates. This is ``None`` when `uses_static_covariates`
        is ``False``.


    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the specified time series do not share any times for which features (and labels if `is_training = True`) can
        be constructed.
    ValueError
        If no lags are specified, or if any of the specified lag values are non-negative.
    ValueError
        If any of the series are too short to create features and/or labels for the requested lags and
        `output_chunk_length` values.
    ValueError
        If `target_series` and/or `output_chunk_length` are *not* specified when `is_training = True`.
    ValueError
        If the provided series do not share the same type of `time_index` (e.g. `target_series` uses a
        pd.RangeIndex, but `future_covariates` uses a `pd.DatetimeIndex`).

    Parameters
    ----------
    target_series
        The series for the regression model to predict.
    output_chunk_length
        The number of timesteps ahead into the future the regression model is to predict.
    past_covariates
        Optionally, the past covariates series that the regression model will use as inputs. Unlike the
        `target_series`, `past_covariates` are *not* to be predicted by the regression model.
    future_covariates
        Optionally, the future covariates (i.e. exogenous covariates) series that the regression model will
        use as inputs.
    lags
        Optionally, the lags of the target series to be used as (auto-regressive) features. If not specified,
        auto-regressive features will *not* be added to `X`. Each lag value is assumed to be negative (e.g.
        `lags = [-3, -1]` will extract `target_series` values which are 3 timesteps and 1 timestep away from
        the current value).
    lags_past_covariates
        Optionally, the lags of `past_covariates` to be used as features. Like `lags`, each lag value is assumed to
        be less than or equal to -1.
    lags_future_covariates
        Optionally, the lags of `future_covariates` to be used as features. Unlike `lags` and `lags_past_covariates`,
        `lags_future_covariates` values can be positive (i.e. use values *after* time `t` to predict target at
        time `t`), zero (i.e. use values *at* time `t` to predict target at time `t`), and/or negative (i.e. use values
        *before* time `t` to predict target at time `t`).
    uses_static_covariates
        Whether the model uses/expects static covariates. If `True`, it enforces that static covariates must
        have identical shapes across all target series.
    last_static_covariates_shape
        Optionally, the last observed shape of the static covariates. This is ``None`` before fitting, or when
        `uses_static_covariates` is ``False``.
    max_samples_per_ts
        Optionally, the maximum number of samples to be drawn for training/validation; only the most recent
        samples are kept. In theory, specifying a smaller `max_samples_per_ts` should reduce computation time,
        especially in cases where many observations could be generated.
    multi_models
        Optionally, specifies whether the regression model predicts multiple timesteps into the future. If `True`,
        then the regression model is assumed to predict all of the timesteps from time `t` to `t+output_chunk_length`.
        If `False`, then the regression model is assumed to predict *only* the timestep at `t+output_chunk_length`.
    check_inputs
        Optionally, specifies that the `lags_*` and `series_*` inputs should be checked for validity. Should be set
        to `False` if inputs have already been checked for validity (e.g. inside the `__init__` of a class), otherwise
        should be set to `True`.
    use_moving_windows
        Optionally, specifies that the 'moving window' method should be used to construct `X` and `y` if all of the

        will always be used, even when all of the provided series are of the same frequency. In general, setting
        to `True` results in faster tabularization at the potential cost of higher memory usage. See Notes for further
        details.
    concatenate
        Optionally, specifies that `X` and `y` should both be returned as single `np.ndarray`s, instead of as
        a `Sequence[np.ndarray]`. If each series input is specified as a `Sequence[TimeSeries]` and
        `concatenate = False`, `X` and `y` will be lists whose `i`th element corresponds to the feature matrix or label
        array formed by the `i`th `TimeSeries` in each `Sequence[TimeSeries]` input. Conversely, if `concatenate = True`
        when `Sequence[TimeSeries]` are provided, then `X` and `y` will be arrays created by concatenating all of the
        feature/label arrays formed by each `TimeSeries` along the `0`th axis. Note that `times` is still returned as
        `Sequence[pd.Index]`, even when `concatenate = True`.

    Returns
    -------
    X
        The constructed features array(s), with shape `(n_observations, n_lagged_features, n_samples)`.
        If the series inputs were specified as `Sequence[TimeSeries]` and `concatenate = False`, then `X`
        is returned as a `Sequence[np.array]`; otherwise, `X` is returned as a single `np.array`.
    y
        The constructed labels array. If `multi_models = True`, then `y` is a
        `(n_observations, output_chunk_length, n_samples)`-shaped array; conversely, if
        `multi_models =  False`, then `y` is a `(n_observations, 1, n_samples)`-shaped array.
        If the series inputs were specified as `Sequence[TimeSeries]` and `concatenate = False`, then `y`
        is returned as a `Sequence[np.array]`; otherwise, `y` is returned as a single `np.array`.
    times
        The `time_index` of each observation in `X` and `y`, returned as a `Sequence` of `pd.Index`es.
        If the series inputs were specified as `Sequence[TimeSeries]`, then the `i`th list element
        gives the times of those observations formed using the `i`th `TimeSeries` object in each
        `Sequence`. Otherwise, if the series inputs were specified as `TimeSeries`, the only
        element is the times of those observations formed from the lone `TimeSeries` inputs.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the specified time series do not share any times for which features and labels can be constructed.
    ValueError
        If no lags are specified, or if any of the specified lag values are non-negative.
    ValueError
        If any of the series are too short to create features and labels for the requested lags and
        `output_chunk_length` values.
    ValueError
        If the provided series do not share the same type of `time_index` (e.g. `target_series` uses a
        pd.RangeIndex, but `future_covariates` uses a `pd.DatetimeIndex`).

    Notes
    -----
    This function is simply a wrapper around `create_lagged_data`; for further details on the structure of `X`, please
    refer to `help(create_lagged_data)`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    target_series
        Optionally, the series for the regression model to predict.
    past_covariates
        Optionally, the past covariates series that the regression model will use as inputs. Unlike the
        `target_series`, `past_covariates` are *not* to be predicted by the regression model.
    future_covariates
        Optionally, the future covariates (i.e. exogenous covariates) series that the regression model will
        use as inputs.
    lags
        Optionally, the lags of the target series to be used as (auto-regressive) features. If not specified,
        auto-regressive features will *not* be added to `X`. Each lag value is assumed to be negative (e.g.
        `lags = [-3, -1]` will extract `target_series` values which are 3 timesteps and 1 timestep away from
        the current value).
    lags_past_covariates
        Optionally, the lags of `past_covariates` to be used as features. Like `lags`, each lag value is assumed to
        be less than or equal to -1.
    lags_future_covariates
        Optionally, the lags of `future_covariates` to be used as features. Unlike `lags` and `lags_past_covariates`,
        `lags_future_covariates` values can be positive (i.e. use values *after* time `t` to predict target at
        time `t`), zero (i.e. use values *at* time `t` to predict target at time `t`), and/or negative (i.e. use
        values *before* time `t` to predict target at time `t`).
    uses_static_covariates
        Whether the model uses/expects static covariates. If `True`, it enforces that static covariates must
        have identical shapes across all target series.
    last_static_covariates_shape
        Optionally, the last observed shape of the static covariates. This is ``None`` before fitting, or when
        `uses_static_covariates` is ``False``.
    max_samples_per_ts
        Optionally, the maximum number of samples to be drawn for training/validation; only the most recent
        samples are kept. In theory, specifying a smaller `max_samples_per_ts` should reduce computation time,
        especially in cases where many observations could be generated.
    check_inputs
        Optionally, specifies that the `lags_*` and `series_*` inputs should be checked for validity. Should be set
        to `False` if inputs have already been checked for validity (e.g. inside the `__init__` of a class), otherwise
        should be set to `True`.
    use_moving_windows
        Optionally, specifies that the 'moving window' method should be used to construct `X` and `y` if all of the
        provided series are of the same frequency. If `use_moving_windows = False`, the 'time intersection' method
        will always be used, even when all of the provided series are of the same frequency. In general, setting
        to `True` results in faster tabularization at the potential cost of higher memory usage. See Notes for further
        details.
    concatenate
        Optionally, specifies that `X` should be returned as a single `np.ndarray`, instead of as a
        `Sequence[np.ndarray]`. If each series input is specified as a `Sequence[TimeSeries]` and `concatenate = False`,
        `X` will be a list whose `i`th element corresponds to the feature matrix or label array formed by the `i`th
        `TimeSeries` in each `Sequence[TimeSeries]` input. Conversely, if `concatenate = True` when
        `Sequence[TimeSeries]` are provided, then `X` will be an array created by concatenating all of the feature
        arrays formed by each `TimeSeries` along the `0`th axis. Note that `times` is still returned as
        `Sequence[pd.Index]`, even when `concatenate = True`.

    Returns
    -------
    X
        The constructed features array(s), with shape `(n_observations, n_lagged_features, n_samples)`.
        If the series inputs were specified as `Sequence[TimeSeries]` and `concatenate = False`, then `X`
        is returned as a `Sequence[np.array]`; otherwise, `X` is returned as a single `np.array`.
    times
        The `time_index` of each observation in `X` and `y`, returned as a `Sequence` of `pd.Index`es.
        If the series inputs were specified as `Sequence[TimeSeries]`, then the `i`th list element
        gives the times of those observations formed using the `i`th `TimeSeries` object in each
        `Sequence`. Otherwise, if the series inputs were specified as `TimeSeries`, the only
        element is the times of those observations formed from the lone `TimeSeries` inputs.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the specified time series do not share any times for which features can be constructed.
    ValueError
        If no lags are specified, or if any of the specified lag values are non-negative.
    ValueError
        If any of the series are too short to create features for the requested lag values.

    Returns a tuple containing the times in `target_series`, the times in `past_covariates`, and the times in

    Notes
    -----
    For the purposes of extracting feature times from each series, we define the `min_lag` and `max_lag` of
    each series to be:
            `min_lag = -max(lags_*)`,
            `max_lag = -min(lags_*)`
    where `lags_*` denotes either `lags`, `lags_past_covariates`, or `lags_future_covariates`.

    For both `lags` and `lags_past_covariates`, `min_lag` and `max_lag` are guaranteed to be positive values,
    since the values in `lags` and `lags_past_covariates` must all be negative. For these two series then,
    `min_lag` and `max_lag` represent the smallest and largest magnitude lags requested by the user. For example:
            `lags = [-3, -2, -1] -> min_lag = 1, max_lag = 3`

    The values contained in `lags_future_covariates`, on the other hand, can be negative, zero, or positive; this
    means that there are three cases to consider:
        1. Both `min_lag` and `max_lag` are positive, which means that all the values in `lags_future_covariates`
        are negative. In this case, `min_lag` and `max_lag` correspond to the to the smallest and largest
        lag magnitudes respectively. For example:
                `lags_future_covariates = [-3, -2, -1] -> min_lag = 1, max_lag = 3`
        2. `min_lag` is non-positive (i.e. zero or negative), but `max_lag` is positive, which means that
        `lags_future_covariates` contains both negative and non-negative (i.e. zero or positive) lag values.
        In this case, `abs(min_lag)` corresponds to the magnitude of the largest *non-negative* lag value in
        `lags_future_covariates`, whilst `max_lag` corresponds to the largest *negative* lag value in
        `lags_future_covariates`. For example:
                `lags_future_covariates = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 3] -> min_lag = -3, max_lag = 2`
        3. Both `min_lag` and `max_lag` are non-positive, which means that `lags_future_covariates` contains
        only non-negative lag values. In this case, `abs(min_lag)` and `abs(max_lag)`, rather confusingly,
        correspond to the largest and smallest lag magnitudes respectively. For example:
                `lags_future_covariates = [1, 2, 3] -> min_lag = -3, max_lag = -1`
    In all three cases, we have `min_lag <= max_lag`. As a direct consequence:
        1. `min_lag > 0` is a sufficient condition for `min_lag` and `max_lag` both being positive (i.e. Case 1).
        2. `max_lag <= 0` is a sufficient condition for `min_lag` and `max_lag` both being non-positive (i.e. Case 2).

    To extract feature times from a `target_series` when `is_training = True`, the following steps are performed:
        1. The first `max_lag` times of the series are excluded; these times have too few preceeding values to
        construct features from.
        2. The last `output_chunk_length - 1` times are excluded; these times have too few succeeding times
        to construct labels from.

    To extract feature times from a `target_series` when `is_training = False`, the following steps are performed:
        1. An additional `min_lag` times are appended to the end of the series; although these times are not contained
        in the original series, we're able to construct features for them since we only need the values of the series
        from time `t - max_lag` to `t - min_lag` to construct a feature for time `t`.
        2. The first `max_lag` times of the series are then excluded; these times have too few preceeding values to
        construct features from.
    The exact same procedure is performed to extract the feature times from a `past_covariates` series.

    To extract feature times from `future_covariates`, we perform the following steps:
        1. Depending on the signs of `min_lag` and `max_lag`, additional times are either prepended or appended
        to the original series. More specifically:
            a) If `min_lag` and `max_lag` are both positive (i.e. `min_lag > 0`), then an additional `min_lag` times
            are appended to the end of the series; as previously mentioned, we only need values up to time `t - min_lag`
            to construct a feature for time `t`.
            b) If `min_lag` and `max_lag` are both non-positive (i.e. `max_lag < 0`), then an additional `abs(max_lag)`
            times are prepended to the start of the series; this is because we only need to know the values of the
            series *after* time `t + abs(max_lag)` to construct a feature for time `t` when we're only extracting
            positive lags from `future_covariates`.
            c) If `min_lag` is non-positive and `max_lag` is positive, then *no additional times* are added to the
            series, since constructing a feature for time `t` requires knowing values from time `t - max_lag` to
            time `t + abs(min_lag)`; in other words, we need to have access to time `t` itself.
        2. If `min_lag < 0`, the last `abs(min_lag)` times are excluded, since these values have fewer
        than `abs(min_lag)` values after them, which means we're unable to construct features for these times.
        3. If `max_lag > 0`, the first `max_lag` times are excluded, since these values have fewer than `max_lag` values
        before them, which means we're unable to construct features for these times.

    Some additional behaviours to note about the `_get_feature_times` function are:
        1. If `return_min_and_max_lags = True`, the smallest and largest lag value for each
        series is also returned as a pair of tuples.
        2. For those series which are either unspecified, a `None` value takes the place of
        that series' feature time, minimum lag values, and maximum lag value.
        3. If `is_training = True`, then `target_series` and `output_chunk_length` must
        be provided.

    Parameters
    ----------
    target_series
        Optionally, the series for the regression model to predict.
    past_covariates
        Optionally, the past covariates series that the regression model will use as inputs. Unlike the
        `target_series`, `past_covariates` are *not* to be predicted by the regression model.
    future_covariates
        Optionally, the future covariates (i.e. exogenous covariates) series that the regression model will
        use as inputs.
    lags
        Optionally, the lags of the target series to be used as (auto-regressive) features. If not specified,
        auto-regressive features will *not* be added to `X`.
    lags_past_covariates
        Optionally, the lags of `past_covariates` to be used as features.
    lags_future_covariates
        Optionally, the lags of `future_covariates` to be used as features.
    output_chunk_length
        Optionally, the number of timesteps ahead into the future the regression model is to predict. This is ignored
        if `is_training = False`.
    is_training
        Optionally, specifies that training data is to be generated from the specified series. If `True`,
        `target_series`, `output_chunk_length`, and `multi_models` must all be specified.
    check_inputs
        Optionally, specifies that the `lags_*` and `series_*` inputs should be checked for validity. Should be set
        to `False` if inputs have already been checked for validity (e.g. inside the `__init__` of a class), otherwise
        should be set to `True`.
    return_min_and_max_lags
        Optionally, specifies whether the largest magnitude lag value for each series should also be returned along with
        the 'eligible' feature times

    Returns
    -------
    feature_times
        A tuple containing all the 'eligible feature times' in `target_series`, in `past_covariates`, and in
        `future_covariates`, in that order. If a particular series-lag pair isn't fully specified, then a `None`
        will take the place of that series' eligible times.
    min_lags
        Optionally, a tuple containing the smallest lag value in `lags`, `lags_past_covariates`, and
        `lags_future_covariates`, in that order. If a particular series-lag pair isn't fully specified, then a `None`
        will take the place of that series' minimum lag values.
    max_lags
        Optionally, a tuple containing the largest lag value in `lags`, `lags_past_covariates`, and
        `lags_future_covariates`, in that order. If a particular series-lag pair isn't fully specified, then a `None`
        will take the place of that series' maximum lag values.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `target_series` and `output_chunk_length` are not both specified if `is_training = True`.
    ValueError
        If any of the `lags` inputs contain non-negative values or if none of the `lags` inputs have been specified.
    ValueError
        If any of the series are too short for the requested `lags` and/or `output_chunk_length` values.
    UserWarning
        If a `lags_*` input is specified without the accompanying time series or vice versa. The only expection to this
        is when `lags` isn't specified alongside `target_series` when `is_training = True`, since one may wish to fit
        a regression model without using auto-regressive features.

    If no potential overlap exists between all of the specified series, `None` is returned instead.

    Notes
    -----
    If all of the specified `series_or_times` are of the same frequency, then `get_shared_times_bounds`
    returns tight `bounds` (i.e. the earliest and latest time within the intersection of all the timeseries

    Extracts moving window views of an `x` array along a specified `axis`, where each window is of length `window_len`
    and consecutive windows are separated by `stride` indices. The total number of extracted windows equals
    `num_windows = (x.shape[axis] - window_len)//stride + 1`.

    Notes
    -----
    This function is similar to `sliding_window_view` in `np.lib.stride_tricks`, except that:
        1. `strided_moving_window` allows for consecutive windows to be separated by a specified `stride`,
        whilst `sliding_window_view` does not.
        2. `strided_moving_window` can only operate along a single axis, whereas `sliding_window_view` can
        operate along multiple axes.
    Additionally, unlike `sliding_window_view`, using `strided_moving_window` doesn't require `numpy >= 1.20.0`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x
        The array from which to extract moving windows.
    window_len
        The size of the extracted moving windows.
    stride
        Optionally, the separation between consecutive windows.
    axis
        Optionally, the axis along which the moving windows should be extracted.
    check_inputs
        Optionally, specifies whether inputs should be checked for validity. Should be set
        to `False` if inputs have already been checked for validity (e.g. inside the `__init__`
        of a class), otherwise should be set to `True`. See [1]_ for further details.

    Returns
    -------
    windows
        The moving windows extracted from `x`. The extracted windows are stacked along the last axis, and the
        `axis` along which the windows were extracted is 'trimmed' such that its length equals the number of
        extracted windows. More specifically, `windows.shape = x_trimmed_shape + (window_len,)`, where
        `x_trimmed_shape` equals `x.shape`, except that `x_trimmed_shape[axis] = num_windows`.

    ------
    ValueError
        If `check_inputs = True` and `window_len` is not positive.
    ValueError
        If `check_inputs = True` and `stride` is not positive.
