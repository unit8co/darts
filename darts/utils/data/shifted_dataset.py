        A time series dataset containing tuples of (past_target, past_covariates, future_target)

        The "future_target" is the "past_target" target shifted by `shift` time steps forward.
        So if an emitted "past_target" (and "past_covariates") goes from position `i` to `i+length`,

        The sampling is uniform over the number of time series; i.e., the i-th sample of this dataset has
        a probability 1/N of coming from any of the N time series in the sequence. If the time series have different

        length

        Contains (past_target, <X>_covariate, future_target), where "<X>" is past if `shift_covariates = False`
        and future otherwise.
        The past chunks have length `input_chunk_length` and the future chunks have length `output_chunk_length`.
        The future chunks start `shift` after the past chunks' start.

        This is meant to be a "generic" dataset that can be used to build ShiftedDataset's
        (when `input_chunk_length = output_chunk_length`), or SequenceDataset's (when `shift = input_chunk_length`).

        Parameters
        ----------
        target_series
            One or a sequence of target `TimeSeries`.
        covariates
            Optionally, one or a sequence of `TimeSeries` containing covariates.
        input_chunk_length
            The length of the emitted past series.
        output_chunk_length
            The length of the emitted future series.
        shift
            The number of time steps by which to shift the output chunks relative to the input chunks.
        shift_covariates
            Whether or not to shift the covariates forward the same way as the target.
            FutureCovariatesModel's require this set to True, while PastCovariatesModel's require this set to False.
        max_samples_per_ts
            This is an upper bound on the number of (input, output, input_covariates) tuples that can be produced
            per time series. It can be used in order to have an upper bound on the total size of the dataset and
            ensure proper sampling. If `None`, it will read all of the individual time series in advance (at dataset
            creation) to know their sizes, which might be expensive on big datasets.
            If some series turn out to have a length that would allow more than `max_samples_per_ts`, only the
            most recent `max_samples_per_ts` samples will be considered.
        covariate_type
            An instance of `CovariateType` describing the type of `covariates`.
