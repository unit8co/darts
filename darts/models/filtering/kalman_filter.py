        """
        This model implements a Kalman filter over a time series.

        The key method is `KalmanFilter.filter()`.
        It considers the provided time series as containing (possibly noisy) observations z obtained from a
        (possibly noisy) linear dynamical system with hidden state x. The function `filter(series)` returns a new
        `TimeSeries` describing the distribution of the output z (without noise), as inferred by the Kalman filter from
        sequentially observing z from `series`, and the dynamics of the linear system of order dim_x.

        This filter also supports missing values in the observation series, in which case the underlying
        Kalman filter will carry on using its mean estimate.

        The method `KalmanFilter.fit()` is used to initialize the Kalman filter by estimating the state space model of
        a linear dynamical system and the covariance matrices of the process and measurement noise using the N4SID
        algorithm.

        This implementation uses Kalman from the NFourSID package. More information can be found here:
        https://nfoursid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/kalman.html.

        The dimensionality of the measurements z and optional control signal (covariates) u is automatically inferred
        upon calling `filter()`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        dim_x : int
            Size of the Kalman filter state vector.
        kf : nfoursid.kalman.Kalman
            Optionally, an instance of `nfoursid.kalman.Kalman`.
            If this is provided, the parameter dim_x is ignored. This instance will be copied for every
            call to `filter()`, so the state is not carried over from one time series to another across several
            calls to `filter()`.
            The dimensionalities of the filter must match those of the `TimeSeries` used when calling `filter()`.
