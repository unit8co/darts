        """Facebook Prophet

        This class provides a basic wrapper around `Facebook Prophet <https://github.com/facebook/prophet>`_.
        It supports adding country holidays as well as custom seasonalities and adds support for stochastic
        forecasting and future covariates.

        Parameters
        ----------
        add_seasonalities
            Optionally, a dict or list of dicts with custom seasonality/ies to add to the model.
            Each dict takes the following mandatory and optional data:

            .. highlight:: python
            .. code-block:: python

                dict({
                'name': str  # (name of the seasonality component),
                'seasonal_periods': Union[int, float]  # (nr of steps composing a season),
                'fourier_order': int  # (number of Fourier components to use),
                'prior_scale': Optional[float]  # (a prior scale for this component),
                'mode': Optional[str]  # ('additive' or 'multiplicative')
                })
            ..

            An example for `seasonal_periods`: If you have hourly data (frequency='H') and your seasonal cycle repeats
            after 48 hours then set `seasonal_periods=48`. Notice that this value will be multiplied by the inferred
            number of days for the TimeSeries frequency (1 / 24 in this example) to be consistent with the
            `add_seasonality()` method of Facebook Prophet, where the `period` parameter is specified in days.

            Apart from `seasonal_periods`, this is very similar to how you would call Facebook Prophet's
            `add_seasonality()` method.
            Alternatively, you can add seasonalities after model creation and before fitting with
            :meth:`add_seasonality() <Prophet.add_seasonality()>`.
        country_holidays
            An optional country code, for which holidays can be taken into account by Prophet.

            See: https://github.com/dr-prodigy/python-holidays

            In addition to those countries, Prophet includes holidays for these
            countries: Brazil (BR), Indonesia (ID), India (IN), Malaysia (MY), Vietnam (VN),
            Thailand (TH), Philippines (PH), Turkey (TU), Pakistan (PK), Bangladesh (BD),
            Egypt (EG), China (CN), and Russia (RU).
        suppress_stdout_stderror
            Optionally suppress the log output produced by Prophet during training.
        add_encoders
            A large number of future covariates can be automatically generated with `add_encoders`.
            This can be done by adding multiple pre-defined index encoders and/or custom user-made functions that
            will be used as index encoders. Additionally, a transformer such as Darts' :class:`Scaler` can be added to
            transform the generated covariates. This happens all under one hood and only needs to be specified at
            model creation.
            Read :meth:`SequentialEncoder <darts.dataprocessing.encoders.SequentialEncoder>` to find out more about
            ``add_encoders``. Default: ``None``. An example showing some of ``add_encoders`` features:

            .. highlight:: python
            .. code-block:: python

                add_encoders={
                    'cyclic': {'future': ['month']},
                    'datetime_attribute': {'future': ['hour', 'dayofweek']},
                    'position': {'future': ['relative']},
                    'custom': {'future': [lambda idx: (idx.year - 1950) / 50]},
                    'transformer': Scaler()
                }
            ..
        cap
            Parameter specifiying the maximum carrying capacity when predicting with logistic growth.
            Mandatory when `growth = 'logistic'`, otherwise ignored.
            See <https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/saturating_forecasts.html> for more information
            on logistic forecasts.
            Can be either

            - a number, for constant carrying capacities
            - a function taking a DatetimeIndex or RangeIndex and returning a corresponding a Sequence of numbers,
            where each number indicates the carrying capacity at this index.
        floor
            Parameter specifiying the minimum carrying capacity when predicting logistic growth.
            Optional when `growth = 'logistic'` (defaults to 0), otherwise ignored.
            See <https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/saturating_forecasts.html> for more information
            on logistic forecasts.

        prophet_kwargs
            Some optional keyword arguments for Prophet.
