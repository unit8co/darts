        """Base Conformal Prediction Model.

        Base class for any conformal prediction model. A conformal model calibrates the predictions from any
        pre-trained global forecasting model. It does not have to be trained, and can generate calibrated forecasts
        directly using the underlying trained forecasting model. Since it is a probabilistic model, you can generate
        forecasts in two ways (when calling `predict()`, `historical_forecasts()`, ...):

        - Predict the calibrated quantile intervals directly: Pass parameters `predict_likelihood_parameters=True`, and
          `num_samples=1` to the forecast method.
        - Predict stochastic samples from the calibrated quantile intervals: Pass parameters
          `predict_likelihood_parameters=False`, and `num_samples>>1` to the forecast method.

        Conformal models can be applied to any of Darts' global forecasting model, as long as the model has been
        fitted before. In general the workflow of the models to produce one calibrated forecast/prediction is as
        follows:

        - Extract a calibration set: The calibration set for each conformal forecast is automatically extracted from
          the most recent past of your input series relative to the forecast start point. The number of calibration
          examples (forecast errors / non-conformity scores) to consider can be defined at model creation with
          parameter `cal_length`. Note that when using `cal_stride>1`, a longer history is required since the
          calibration examples are generated with stridden historical forecasts.
        - Generate historical forecasts on the calibration set (using the forecasting model) with a stride `cal_stride`.
        - Compute the errors/non-conformity scores (specific to each conformal model) on these historical forecasts
        - Compute the quantile values from the errors / non-conformity scores (using our desired quantiles set at model
          creation with parameter `quantiles`).
        - Compute the conformal prediction: Using these quantile values, add calibrated intervals to (or adjust the
          existing intervals of) the forecasting model's predictions.

        Some notes:

        - When computing `historical_forecasts()`, `backtest()`, `residuals()`, ... the above is applied for each
          forecast (the forecasting model's historical forecasts are only generated once for efficiency).
        - For multi-horizon forecasts, the above is applied for each step in the horizon separately.

        Parameters
        ----------
        model
            A pre-trained global forecasting model. See the list of models
            `here <https://unit8co.github.io/darts/#forecasting-models>`_.
        quantiles
            A list of quantiles centered around the median `q=0.5` to use. For example quantiles
            [0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8 0.9] correspond to two intervals with (0.9 - 0.1) = 80%, and (0.8 - 0.2) 60% coverage
            around the median (model forecast).
        symmetric
            Whether to use symmetric non-conformity scores. If `False`, uses asymmetric scores (individual scores
            for lower- and upper quantile interval bounds).
        cal_length
            The number of past forecast errors / non-conformity scores to use as calibration for each conformal
            forecast (and each step in the horizon). If `None`, considers all scores.
        cal_stride
            The stride to apply when computing the historical forecasts and non-conformity scores on the calibration
            set. The actual conformal forecasts can have a different stride given with parameter `stride` in downstream
            tasks (e.g. historical forecasts, backtest, ...)
        cal_num_samples
            The number of samples to generate for each calibration forecast (if `model` is a probabilistic forecasting
            model). The non-conformity scores are computed on the quantile values of these forecasts (using quantiles
            `quantiles`). Uses `1` for deterministic models. The actual conformal forecasts can have a different number
            of samples given with parameter `num_samples` in downstream tasks (e.g. predict, historical forecasts, ...).
        random_state
            Control the randomness of probabilistic conformal forecasts (sample generation) across different runs.

        end of the `series`.

        It is important that the input series for prediction correspond to a calibration set - a set different to the
        series that the underlying forecasting `model` was trained on.

        Since it is a probabilistic model, you can generate forecasts in two ways:

        - Predict the calibrated quantile intervals directly: Pass parameters `predict_likelihood_parameters=True`, and
          `num_samples=1` to the forecast method.
        - Predict stochastic samples from the calibrated quantile intervals: Pass parameters
          `predict_likelihood_parameters=False`, and `num_samples>>1` to the forecast method.

        Under the hood, the simplified workflow to produce one calibrated forecast/prediction for every step in the
        horizon `n` is as follows (note: `cal_length` and `cal_stride` can be set at model creation):

        - Extract a calibration set: The calibration set for each conformal forecast is automatically extracted from
          the most recent past of your input series relative to the forecast start point. The number of calibration
          examples (forecast errors / non-conformity scores) to consider can be defined at model creation
          with parameter `cal_length`. Note that when using `cal_stride>1`, a longer history is required since
          the calibration examples are generated with stridden historical forecasts.
        - Generate historical forecasts on the calibration set (using the forecasting model) with a stride `cal_stride`.
        - Compute the errors/non-conformity scores (specific to each conformal model) on these historical forecasts
        - Compute the quantile values from the errors / non-conformity scores (using our desired quantiles set at model
          creation with parameter `quantiles`).
        - Compute the conformal prediction: Using these quantile values, add calibrated intervals to (or adjust the
          existing intervals of) the forecasting model's predictions.

        Parameters
        ----------
        n
            Forecast horizon - the number of time steps after the end of the series for which to produce predictions.
        series
            A series or sequence of series, representing the history of the target series whose future is to be
            predicted. Will use the past of this series for calibration. The series should not have any overlap with
            the series used to train the forecasting model.
        past_covariates
            Optionally, a (sequence of) past-observed covariate time series for every input time series in `series`.
            Their dimension must match that of the past covariates used for training. Will use this series for
            calibration.
        future_covariates
            Optionally, a (sequence of) future-known covariate time series for every input time series in `series`.
            Their dimension must match that of the past covariates used for training. Will use this series for
            calibration.
        num_samples
            Number of times a prediction is sampled from the calibrated quantile predictions using linear
            interpolation in-between the quantiles. For larger values, the sample distribution approximates the
            calibrated quantile predictions.
        verbose
            Whether to print the progress.
        predict_likelihood_parameters
            If set to `True`, generates the quantile predictions directly. Only supported with `num_samples = 1`.
        show_warnings
            Whether to show warnings related auto-regression and past covariates usage.
        **kwargs
            Optional keyword arguments that will passed to the underlying forecasting model's `predict()` and
            `historical_forecasts()` methods.

        Returns
        -------
        Union[TimeSeries, Sequence[TimeSeries]]
            If `series` is not specified, this function returns a single time series containing the `n`
            next points after then end of the training series.
            If `series` is given and is a simple ``TimeSeries``, this function returns the `n` next points
            after the end of `series`.
            If `series` is given and is a sequence of several time series, this function returns
            a sequence where each element contains the corresponding `n` points forecasts.

        history of the provided (potentially multiple) `series`. This process involves retrospectively applying the
        model to different time steps, as if the forecasts were made in real-time at those specific moments. This
        allows for an evaluation of the model's performance over the entire duration of the series, providing insights
        into its predictive accuracy and robustness across different historical periods.

        Currently, conformal models only support the pre-trained historical forecasts mode (`retrain=False`).
        Parameters `retrain` and `train_length` are ignored.

        **Pre-trained Mode:** First, all historical forecasts are generated using the underlying pre-trained global
        forecasting model (see :meth:`ForecastingModel.historical_forecasts()
        <darts.models.forecasting.forecasting_model.ForecastingModel.historical_forecasts>` for more info). Then it
        repeatedly builds a calibration set by either expanding from the beginning of the historical forecasts or by
        using a fixed-length moving window with length `cal_length` (the start point can also be configured with
        `start` and `start_format`).
        The next forecast of length `forecast_horizon` is then calibrated on this calibration set. Subsequently, the
        end of the calibration set is moved forward by `stride` time steps, and the process is repeated.

        By default, with `last_points_only=True`, this method returns a single time series (or a sequence of time
        series when `series` is also a sequence of series) composed of the last point from each calibrated historical
        forecast. This time series will thus have a frequency of `series.freq * stride`.
        If `last_points_only=False`, it will instead return a list (or a sequence of lists) with all calibrated
        historical forecasts of length `forecast_horizon` and frequency `series.freq`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        series
            A (sequence of) target time series used to successively compute the historical forecasts. Will use the past

            calibration.
        future_covariates
            Optionally, a (sequence of) future-known covariate time series for every input time series in `series`.

            The forecast horizon for the predictions.
        num_samples
            Number of times a prediction is sampled from the calibrated quantile predictions using linear
            interpolation in-between the quantiles. For larger values, the sample distribution approximates the
            calibrated quantile predictions.
        train_length
            Currently ignored by conformal models.
        start
            Optionally, the first point in time at which a prediction is computed. This parameter supports:
            ``int``, ``pandas.Timestamp``, and ``None``.
            If an ``int``, it is either the index position of the first prediction point for `series` with a
            `pd.DatetimeIndex`, or the index value for `series` with a `pd.RangeIndex`. The latter can be changed to
            the index position with `start_format="position"`.
            If a ``pandas.Timestamp``, it is the time stamp of the first prediction point.
            If ``None``, the first prediction point will automatically be set to:

            - the first predictable point if `retrain` is ``False``, or `retrain` is a Callable and the first
              predictable point is earlier than the first trainable point.
            - the first trainable point if `retrain` is ``True`` or ``int`` (given `train_length`),
              or `retrain` is a ``Callable`` and the first trainable point is earlier than the first predictable point.
            - the first trainable point (given `train_length`) otherwise

            Note: If the model uses a shifted output (`output_chunk_shift > 0`), then the first predicted point is also
            shifted by `output_chunk_shift` points into the future.
            Note: Raises a ValueError if `start` yields a time outside the time index of `series`.
            Note: If `start` is outside the possible historical forecasting times, will ignore the parameter
            (default behavior with ``None``) and start at the first trainable/predictable point.
        start_format
            Defines the `start` format.
            If set to ``'position'``, `start` corresponds to the index position of the first predicted point and can
            range from `(-len(series), len(series) - 1)`.
            If set to ``'value'``, `start` corresponds to the index value/label of the first predicted point. Will raise
            an error if the value is not in `series`' index. Default: ``'value'``.
        stride
            The number of time steps between two consecutive predictions. Must be a round-multiple of `cal_stride`
            (set at model creation) and `>=cal_stride`.
        retrain
            Currently ignored by conformal models.
        overlap_end
            Whether the returned forecasts can go beyond the series' end or not.
        last_points_only
            Whether to return only the last point of each historical forecast. If set to ``True``, the method returns a
            single ``TimeSeries`` (for each time series in `series`) containing the successive point forecasts.
            Otherwise, returns a list of historical ``TimeSeries`` forecasts.
        verbose
            Whether to print the progress.
        show_warnings
            Whether to show warnings related to historical forecasts optimization, or parameters `start` and
            `train_length`.
        predict_likelihood_parameters
            If set to `True`, generates the quantile predictions directly. Only supported with `num_samples = 1`.
        enable_optimization
            Whether to use the optimized version of `historical_forecasts` when supported and available.
            Default: ``True``.
        data_transformers
            Optionally, a dictionary of `BaseDataTransformer` or `Pipeline` to apply to the corresponding series
            (possibles keys; "series", "past_covariates", "future_covariates"). If provided, all input series must be
            in the un-transformed space. For fittable transformer / pipeline:

            - if `retrain=True`, the data transformer re-fit on the training data at each historical forecast step
              (currently ignored by conformal models).
            - if `retrain=False`, the data transformer transforms the series once before all the forecasts.

            The fitted transformer is used to transform the input during both training and prediction.
            If the transformation is invertible, the forecasts will be inverse-transformed.
        fit_kwargs
            Currently ignored by conformal models.
        predict_kwargs
            Optionally, some additional arguments passed to the model `predict()` method.
        sample_weight
            Currently ignored by conformal models.

            A list of historical forecasts for:

            - a sequence (list) of `series` and `last_points_only=True`: for each series, it contains only the
              predictions at step `forecast_horizon` from all historical forecasts.
            - a single `series` and `last_points_only=False`: for each historical forecast, it contains the entire

        list[list[TimeSeries]]
            A list of lists of historical forecasts for a sequence of `series` and `last_points_only=False`. For each

            is over the series provided in the input sequence, and the inner lists contain the historical forecasts for
            each series.

        If `historical_forecasts` are provided, the metric(s) (given by the `metric` function) is evaluated directly on
        all forecasts and actual values. The same `series` and `last_points_only` value must be passed that were used
        to generate the historical forecasts. Finally, the method returns an optional `reduction` (the mean by default)
        of all these metric scores.

        If `historical_forecasts` is ``None``, it first generates the historical forecasts with the parameters given
        below (see :meth:`ConformalModel.historical_forecasts()
        <darts.models.forecasting.conformal_models.ConformalModel.historical_forecasts>` for more info) and then

        The metric(s) can be further customized `metric_kwargs` (e.g. control the aggregation over components, time
        steps, multiple series, other required arguments such as `q` for quantile metrics, ...).

        Notes
        -----
        Darts has several metrics to evaluate probabilistic forecasts. For conformal models, we recommend using
        quantile interval metrics (see `here <https://unit8co.github.io/darts/generated_api/darts.metrics.html>`_).
        You can specify which intervals to evaluate by setting `metric_kwargs={'q_interval': my_intervals}`. To check
        all intervals used by your conformal model `my_model`, you can set ``{'q_interval': my_model.q_interval}``.

        Parameters
        ----------
        series
            A (sequence of) target time series used to successively compute the historical forecasts. Will use the past
            of this series for calibration. The series should not have any overlap with the series used to train the
            forecasting model.
        past_covariates
            Optionally, a (sequence of) past-observed covariate time series for every input time series in `series`.
            Their dimension must match that of the past covariates used for training. Will use this series for
            calibration.
        future_covariates
            Optionally, a (sequence of) future-known covariate time series for every input time series in `series`.
            Their dimension must match that of the past covariates used for training. Will use this series for
            calibration.
        historical_forecasts
            Optionally, the (or a sequence of / a sequence of sequences of) historical forecasts time series to be
            evaluated. Corresponds to the output of :meth:`historical_forecasts()
            <darts.models.forecasting.conformal_models.ConformalModel.historical_forecasts>`. The same `series` and
            `last_points_only` values must be passed that were used to generate the historical forecasts. If provided,
            will skip historical forecasting and ignore all parameters except `series`, `last_points_only`, `metric`,
            and `reduction`.
        forecast_horizon
            The forecast horizon for the predictions.
        num_samples
            Number of times a prediction is sampled from the calibrated quantile predictions using linear
            interpolation in-between the quantiles. For larger values, the sample distribution approximates the
            calibrated quantile predictions.
        train_length
            Currently ignored by conformal models.
        start
            Optionally, the first point in time at which a prediction is computed. This parameter supports:
            ``int``, ``pandas.Timestamp``, and ``None``.
            If an ``int``, it is either the index position of the first prediction point for `series` with a
            `pd.DatetimeIndex`, or the index value for `series` with a `pd.RangeIndex`. The latter can be changed to
            the index position with `start_format="position"`.
            If a ``pandas.Timestamp``, it is the time stamp of the first prediction point.
            If ``None``, the first prediction point will automatically be set to:

            - the first predictable point if `retrain` is ``False``, or `retrain` is a Callable and the first
              predictable point is earlier than the first trainable point.
            - the first trainable point if `retrain` is ``True`` or ``int`` (given `train_length`),
              or `retrain` is a ``Callable`` and the first trainable point is earlier than the first predictable point.
            - the first trainable point (given `train_length`) otherwise

            Note: If the model uses a shifted output (`output_chunk_shift > 0`), then the first predicted point is also
            shifted by `output_chunk_shift` points into the future.
            Note: Raises a ValueError if `start` yields a time outside the time index of `series`.
            Note: If `start` is outside the possible historical forecasting times, will ignore the parameter
            (default behavior with ``None``) and start at the first trainable/predictable point.
        start_format
            Defines the `start` format.
            If set to ``'position'``, `start` corresponds to the index position of the first predicted point and can
            range from `(-len(series), len(series) - 1)`.
            If set to ``'value'``, `start` corresponds to the index value/label of the first predicted point. Will raise
            an error if the value is not in `series`' index. Default: ``'value'``.
        stride
            The number of time steps between two consecutive predictions.
        retrain
            Currently ignored by conformal models.
        overlap_end
            Whether the returned forecasts can go beyond the series' end or not.
        last_points_only
            Whether to return only the last point of each historical forecast. If set to ``True``, the method returns a
            single ``TimeSeries`` (for each time series in `series`) containing the successive point forecasts.
            Otherwise, returns a list of historical ``TimeSeries`` forecasts.
        metric
            A metric function or a list of metric functions. Each metric must either be a Darts metric (see `here
            <https://unit8co.github.io/darts/generated_api/darts.metrics.html>`_), or a custom metric that has an
            identical signature as Darts' metrics, uses decorators :func:`~darts.metrics.metrics.multi_ts_support` and
            :func:`~darts.metrics.metrics.multi_ts_support`, and returns the metric score.
        reduction
            A function used to combine the individual error scores obtained when `last_points_only` is set to `False`.
            When providing several metric functions, the function will receive the argument `axis = 1` to obtain single
            value for each metric function.
            If explicitly set to `None`, the method will return a list of the individual error scores instead.
            Set to ``np.mean`` by default.
        verbose
            Whether to print the progress.
        show_warnings
            Whether to show warnings related to historical forecasts optimization, or parameters `start` and
            `train_length`.
        predict_likelihood_parameters
            If set to `True`, generates the quantile predictions directly. Only supported with `num_samples = 1`.
        enable_optimization
            Whether to use the optimized version of `historical_forecasts` when supported and available.
            Default: ``True``.
        data_transformers
            Optionally, a dictionary of `BaseDataTransformer` or `Pipeline` to apply to the corresponding series
            (possibles keys; "series", "past_covariates", "future_covariates"). If provided, all input series must be
            in the un-transformed space. For fittable transformer / pipeline:

            - if `retrain=True`, the data transformer re-fit on the training data at each historical forecast step
              (currently ignored by conformal models).
            - if `retrain=False`, the data transformer transforms the series once before all the forecasts.

            The fitted transformer is used to transform the input during both training and prediction.
            If the transformation is invertible, the forecasts will be inverse-transformed.
            Only effective when `historical_forecasts=None`.
        metric_kwargs
            Additional arguments passed to `metric()`, such as `'n_jobs'` for parallelization, `'component_reduction'`
            for reducing the component wise metrics, seasonality `'m'` for scaled metrics, etc. Will pass arguments to
            each metric separately and only if they are present in the corresponding metric signature. Parameter
            `'insample'` for scaled metrics (e.g. mase`, `rmsse`, ...) is ignored, as it is handled internally.
        fit_kwargs
            Currently ignored by conformal models.
        predict_kwargs
            Optionally, some additional arguments passed to the model `predict()` method.
        sample_weight
            Currently ignored by conformal models.

        Returns
        -------
        float
            A single backtest score for single uni/multivariate series, a single `metric` function and:

            - `historical_forecasts` generated with `last_points_only=True`
            - `historical_forecasts` generated with `last_points_only=False` and using a backtest `reduction`
        np.ndarray
            An numpy array of backtest scores. For single series and one of:

            - a single `metric` function, `historical_forecasts` generated with `last_points_only=False`
              and backtest `reduction=None`. The output has shape (n forecasts, *).
            - multiple `metric` functions and `historical_forecasts` generated with `last_points_only=False`.
              The output has shape (*, n metrics) when using a backtest `reduction`, and (n forecasts, *, n metrics)
              when `reduction=None`
            - multiple uni/multivariate series including `series_reduction` and at least one of
              `component_reduction=None` or `time_reduction=None` for "per time step metrics"
        list[float]
            Same as for type `float` but for a sequence of series. The returned metric list has length
            `len(series)` with the `float` metric for each input `series`.
        list[np.ndarray]

        """Compute the residuals that the model produced for historical forecasts on (potentially multiple) `series`.

        This function computes the difference (or one of Darts' "per time step" metrics) between the actual
        observations from `series` and the fitted values obtained by training the model on `series` (or using a
        pre-trained model with `retrain=False`). Not all models support fitted values, so we use historical forecasts
        as an approximation for them.

        In sequence this method performs:

        - use pre-computed `historical_forecasts` or compute historical forecasts for each series (see
          :meth:`~darts.models.forecasting.conformal_models.ConformalModel.historical_forecasts` for more details).
          How the historical forecasts are generated can be configured with parameters `num_samples`, `train_length`,
          `start`, `start_format`, `forecast_horizon`, `stride`, `retrain`, `last_points_only`, `fit_kwargs`, and
          `predict_kwargs`.
        - compute a backtest using a "per time step" `metric` between the historical forecasts and `series` per
          component/column and time step (see
          :meth:`~darts.models.forecasting.conformal_models.ConformalModel.backtest` for more details). By default,
          uses the residuals :func:`~darts.metrics.metrics.err` (error) as a `metric`.
        - create and return `TimeSeries` (or simply a np.ndarray with `values_only=True`) with the time index from
          historical forecasts, and values from the metrics per component and time step.

        This method works for single or multiple univariate or multivariate series.
        It uses the median prediction (when dealing with stochastic forecasts).

        Notes
        -----
        Darts has several metrics to evaluate probabilistic forecasts. For conformal models, we recommend using
        "per time step" quantile interval metrics (see `here
        <https://unit8co.github.io/darts/generated_api/darts.metrics.html>`_). You can specify which intervals to
        evaluate by setting `metric_kwargs={'q_interval': my_intervals}`. To check all intervals used by your conformal
        model `my_model`, you can set ``{'q_interval': my_model.q_interval}``.

        Parameters
        ----------
        series
            A (sequence of) target time series used to successively compute the historical forecasts. Will use the past
            of this series for calibration. The series should not have any overlap with the series used to train the
            forecasting model.
        past_covariates
            Optionally, a (sequence of) past-observed covariate time series for every input time series in `series`.
            Their dimension must match that of the past covariates used for training. Will use this series for
            calibration.
        future_covariates
            Optionally, a (sequence of) future-known covariate time series for every input time series in `series`.
            Their dimension must match that of the past covariates used for training. Will use this series for
            calibration.
        historical_forecasts
            Optionally, the (or a sequence of / a sequence of sequences of) historical forecasts time series to be
            evaluated. Corresponds to the output of :meth:`historical_forecasts()
            <darts.models.forecasting.conformal_models.ConformalModel.historical_forecasts>`. The same `series` and
            `last_points_only` values must be passed that were used to generate the historical forecasts. If provided,
            will skip historical forecasting and ignore all parameters except `series`, `last_points_only`, `metric`,
            and `reduction`.
        forecast_horizon
            The forecast horizon for the predictions.
        num_samples
            Number of times a prediction is sampled from the calibrated quantile predictions using linear
            interpolation in-between the quantiles. For larger values, the sample distribution approximates the
            calibrated quantile predictions.
        train_length
            Currently ignored by conformal models.
        start
            Optionally, the first point in time at which a prediction is computed. This parameter supports:
            ``int``, ``pandas.Timestamp``, and ``None``.
            If an ``int``, it is either the index position of the first prediction point for `series` with a
            `pd.DatetimeIndex`, or the index value for `series` with a `pd.RangeIndex`. The latter can be changed to
            the index position with `start_format="position"`.
            If a ``pandas.Timestamp``, it is the time stamp of the first prediction point.
            If ``None``, the first prediction point will automatically be set to:

            - the first predictable point if `retrain` is ``False``, or `retrain` is a Callable and the first
              predictable point is earlier than the first trainable point.
            - the first trainable point if `retrain` is ``True`` or ``int`` (given `train_length`),
              or `retrain` is a ``Callable`` and the first trainable point is earlier than the first predictable point.
            - the first trainable point (given `train_length`) otherwise

            Note: If the model uses a shifted output (`output_chunk_shift > 0`), then the first predicted point is also
            shifted by `output_chunk_shift` points into the future.
            Note: Raises a ValueError if `start` yields a time outside the time index of `series`.
            Note: If `start` is outside the possible historical forecasting times, will ignore the parameter
            (default behavior with ``None``) and start at the first trainable/predictable point.
        start_format
            Defines the `start` format.
            If set to ``'position'``, `start` corresponds to the index position of the first predicted point and can
            range from `(-len(series), len(series) - 1)`.
            If set to ``'value'``, `start` corresponds to the index value/label of the first predicted point. Will raise
            an error if the value is not in `series`' index. Default: ``'value'``.
        stride
            The number of time steps between two consecutive predictions.
        retrain
            Currently ignored by conformal models.
        overlap_end
            Whether the returned forecasts can go beyond the series' end or not.
        last_points_only
            Whether to return only the last point of each historical forecast. If set to ``True``, the method returns a
            single ``TimeSeries`` (for each time series in `series`) containing the successive point forecasts.
            Otherwise, returns a list of historical ``TimeSeries`` forecasts.
        metric
            Either one of Darts' "per time step" metrics (see `here
            <https://unit8co.github.io/darts/generated_api/darts.metrics.html>`_), or a custom metric that has an
            identical signature as Darts' "per time step" metrics, uses decorators
            :func:`~darts.metrics.metrics.multi_ts_support` and :func:`~darts.metrics.metrics.multi_ts_support`,
            and returns one value per time step.
        verbose
            Whether to print the progress.
        show_warnings
            Whether to show warnings related to historical forecasts optimization, or parameters `start` and
            `train_length`.
        predict_likelihood_parameters
            If set to `True`, generates the quantile predictions directly. Only supported with `num_samples = 1`.
        enable_optimization
            Whether to use the optimized version of `historical_forecasts` when supported and available.
            Default: ``True``.
        data_transformers
            Optionally, a dictionary of `BaseDataTransformer` or `Pipeline` to apply to the corresponding series
            (possibles keys; "series", "past_covariates", "future_covariates"). If provided, all input series must be
            in the un-transformed space. For fittable transformer / pipeline:

            - if `retrain=True`, the data transformer re-fit on the training data at each historical forecast step
              (currently ignored by conformal models).
            - if `retrain=False`, the data transformer transforms the series once before all the forecasts.

            The fitted transformer is used to transform the input during both training and prediction.
            If the transformation is invertible, the forecasts will be inverse-transformed.
            Only effective when `historical_forecasts=None`.
        metric_kwargs
            Additional arguments passed to `metric()`, such as `'n_jobs'` for parallelization, `'m'` for scaled
            metrics, etc. Will pass arguments only if they are present in the corresponding metric signature. Ignores
            reduction arguments `"series_reduction", "component_reduction", "time_reduction"`, and parameter
            `'insample'` for scaled metrics (e.g. mase`, `rmsse`, ...), as they are handled internally.
        fit_kwargs
            Currently ignored by conformal models.
        predict_kwargs
            Optionally, some additional arguments passed to the model `predict()` method.
        sample_weight
            Currently ignored by conformal models.
        values_only
            Whether to return the residuals as `np.ndarray`. If `False`, returns residuals as `TimeSeries`.

        Returns
        -------
        TimeSeries
            Residual `TimeSeries` for a single `series` and `historical_forecasts` generated with
            `last_points_only=True`.
        list[TimeSeries]
            A list of residual `TimeSeries` for a sequence (list) of `series` with `last_points_only=True`.
            The residual list has length `len(series)`.
        list[list[TimeSeries]]
            A list of lists of residual `TimeSeries` for a sequence of `series` with `last_points_only=False`.
            The outer residual list has length `len(series)`. The inner lists consist of the residuals from
            all possible series-specific historical forecasts.

        """Naive Conformal Prediction Model.

        A probabilistic model that adds calibrated intervals around the median forecast from a pre-trained
        global forecasting model. It does not have to be trained and can generated calibrated forecasts
        directly using the underlying trained forecasting model. It supports two symmetry modes:

        - `symmetric=True`:
            - The lower and upper interval bounds are calibrated with the same magnitude.
            - Non-conformity scores: uses metric `ae()` (see absolute error :func:`~darts.metrics.metrics.ae`) to
              compute the non-conformity scores on the calibration set.
        - `symmetric=False`
            - The lower and upper interval bounds are calibrated separately.
            - Non-conformity scores: uses metric `err()` (see error :func:`~darts.metrics.metrics.err`) to compute the
              non-conformity scores on the calibration set for the upper bounds, an `-err()` for the lower bounds.

        Since it is a probabilistic model, you can generate forecasts in two ways (when calling `predict()`,
        `historical_forecasts()`, ...):

        - Predict the calibrated quantile intervals directly: Pass parameters `predict_likelihood_parameters=True`, and
          `num_samples=1` to the forecast method.
        - Predict stochastic samples from the calibrated quantile intervals: Pass parameters
          `predict_likelihood_parameters=False`, and `num_samples>>1` to the forecast method.

        Conformal models can be applied to any of Darts' global forecasting model, as long as the model has been
        fitted before. In general the workflow of the models to produce one calibrated forecast/prediction is as
        follows:

        - Extract a calibration set: The calibration set for each conformal forecast is automatically extracted from
          the most recent past of your input series relative to the forecast start point. The number of calibration
          examples (forecast errors / non-conformity scores) to consider can be defined at model creation
          with parameter `cal_length`. Note that when using `cal_stride>1`, a longer history is required since
          the calibration examples are generated with stridden historical forecasts.
        - Generate historical forecasts on the calibration set (using the forecasting model) with a stride `cal_stride`.
        - Compute the errors/non-conformity scores (as defined above) on these historical forecasts
        - Compute the quantile values from the errors / non-conformity scores (using our desired quantiles set at model
          creation with parameter `quantiles`).
        - Compute the conformal prediction: Using these quantile values, add calibrated intervals to the forecasting
          model's predictions.

        Some notes:

        - When computing `historical_forecasts()`, `backtest()`, `residuals()`, ... the above is applied for each
          forecast (the forecasting model's historical forecasts are only generated once for efficiency).
        - For multi-horizon forecasts, the above is applied for each step in the horizon separately.

        Parameters
        ----------
        model
            A pre-trained global forecasting model. See the list of models
            `here <https://unit8co.github.io/darts/#forecasting-models>`_.
        quantiles
            A list of quantiles centered around the median `q=0.5` to use. For example quantiles
            [0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8 0.9] correspond to two intervals with (0.9 - 0.1) = 80%, and (0.8 - 0.2) 60% coverage
            around the median (model forecast).
        symmetric
            Whether to use symmetric non-conformity scores. If `True`, uses metric `ae()` (see
            :func:`~darts.metrics.metrics.ae`) to compute the non-conformity scores. If `False`, uses metric `-err()`
            (see :func:`~darts.metrics.metrics.err`) for the lower, and `err()` for the upper quantile interval bound.
        cal_length
            The number of past forecast errors / non-conformity scores to use as calibration for each conformal
            forecast (and each step in the horizon). If `None`, considers all scores.
        cal_stride
            The stride to apply when computing the historical forecasts and non-conformity scores on the calibration
            set. The actual conformal forecasts can have a different stride given with parameter `stride` in downstream
            tasks (e.g. historical forecasts, backtest, ...)
        cal_num_samples
            The number of samples to generate for each calibration forecast (if `model` is a probabilistic forecasting
            model). The non-conformity scores are computed on the quantile values of these forecasts (using quantiles
            `quantiles`). Uses `1` for deterministic models. The actual conformal forecasts can have a different number
            of samples given with parameter `num_samples` in downstream tasks (e.g. predict, historical forecasts, ...).
        random_state
            Control the randomness of probabilistic conformal forecasts (sample generation) across different runs.

        """Conformalized Quantile Regression Model.

        A probabilistic model that calibrates the quantile predictions from a pre-trained probabilistic global
        forecasting model. It does not have to be trained and can generated calibrated forecasts
        directly using the underlying trained forecasting model. It supports two symmetry modes:

        - `symmetric=True`:
            - The lower and upper quantile predictions are calibrated with the same magnitude.
            - Non-conformity scores: uses metric `incs_qr(symmetric=True)` (see Non-Conformity Score for Quantile
              Regression :func:`~darts.metrics.metrics.incs_qr`) to compute the non-conformity scores on the calibration
              set.
        - `symmetric=False`
            - The lower and upper quantile predictions are calibrated separately.
            - Non-conformity scores: uses metric `incs_qr(symmetric=False)` (see Non-Conformity Score for Quantile
              Regression :func:`~darts.metrics.metrics.incs_qr`) to compute the non-conformity scores for the upper and
              lower bound separately.

        Since it is a probabilistic model, you can generate forecasts in two ways (when calling `predict()`,
        `historical_forecasts()`, ...):

        - Predict the calibrated quantile intervals directly: Pass parameters `predict_likelihood_parameters=True`, and
          `num_samples=1` to the forecast method.
        - Predict stochastic samples from the calibrated quantile intervals: Pass parameters
          `predict_likelihood_parameters=False`, and `num_samples>>1` to the forecast method.

        Conformal models can be applied to any of Darts' global forecasting model, as long as the model has been
        fitted before. In general the workflow of the models to produce one calibrated forecast/prediction is as
        follows:

        - Extract a calibration set: The calibration set for each conformal forecast is automatically extracted from
          the most recent past of your input series relative to the forecast start point. The number of calibration
          examples (forecast errors / non-conformity scores) to consider can be defined at model creation with
          parameter `cal_length`. Note that when using `cal_stride>1`, a longer history is required since the
          calibration examples are generated with stridden historical forecasts.
        - Generate historical forecasts (quantile predictions) on the calibration set (using the forecasting model)
          with a stride `cal_stride`.
        - Compute the errors/non-conformity scores (as defined above) on these historical quantile predictions
        - Compute the quantile values from the errors / non-conformity scores (using our desired quantiles set at model
          creation with parameter `quantiles`).
        - Compute the conformal prediction: Using these quantile values, calibrate the predicted quantiles from the
          forecasting model's predictions.

        Some notes:

        - When computing `historical_forecasts()`, `backtest()`, `residuals()`, ... the above is applied for each
          forecast (the forecasting model's historical forecasts are only generated once for efficiency).
        - For multi-horizon forecasts, the above is applied for each step in the horizon separately.

        Parameters
        ----------
        model
            A pre-trained global forecasting model. See the list of models
            `here <https://unit8co.github.io/darts/#forecasting-models>`_.
        quantiles
            A list of quantiles centered around the median `q=0.5` to use. For example quantiles
            [0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8 0.9] correspond to two intervals with (0.9 - 0.1) = 80%, and (0.8 - 0.2) 60% coverage
            around the median (model forecast).
        symmetric
            Whether to use symmetric non-conformity scores. If `True`, uses symmetric metric
            `incs_qr(..., symmetric=True)` (see :func:`~darts.metrics.metrics.incs_qr`) to compute the non-conformity
            scores. If `False`, uses asymmetric metric `incs_qr(..., symmetric=False)` with individual scores for the
            lower- and upper quantile interval bounds.
        cal_length
            The number of past forecast errors / non-conformity scores to use as calibration for each conformal
            forecast (and each step in the horizon). If `None`, considers all scores.
        cal_stride
            The stride to apply when computing the historical forecasts and non-conformity scores on the calibration
            set. The actual conformal forecasts can have a different stride given with parameter `stride` in downstream
            tasks (e.g. historical forecasts, backtest, ...)
        cal_num_samples
            The number of samples to generate for each calibration forecast (if `model` is a probabilistic forecasting
            model). The non-conformity scores are computed on the quantile values of these forecasts (using quantiles
            `quantiles`). Uses `1` for deterministic models. The actual conformal forecasts can have a different number
            of samples given with parameter `num_samples` in downstream tasks (e.g. predict, historical forecasts, ...).
        random_state
            Control the randomness of probabilistic conformal forecasts (sample generation) across different runs.
