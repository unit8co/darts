"""
Forecasting Model Base Classes

A forecasting model captures the future values of a time series as a function of the past as follows:

.. math:: y_{t+1} = f(y_t, y_{t-1}, ..., y_1),

where :math:`y_t` represents the time series' value(s) at time :math:`t`.

The main functions are `fit()` and `predict()`. `fit()` learns the function `f()`, over the history of
one or several time series. The function `predict()` applies `f()` on one or several time series in order
to obtain forecasts for a desired number of time stamps into the future.

        """Compute the historical forecasts that would have been obtained by this model on
        (potentially multiple) `series`.

        This method repeatedly builds a training set: either expanding from the beginning of `series` or moving with
        a fixed length `train_length`. It trains the model on the training set, emits a forecast of length equal to
        forecast_horizon, and then moves the end of the training set forward by `stride` time steps.

        By default, this method will return one (or a sequence of) single time series made up of
        the last point of each historical forecast.
        This time series will thus have a frequency of ``series.freq * stride``.
        If `last_points_only` is set to False, it will instead return one (or a sequence of) list of the
        historical forecasts series.

        By default, this method always re-trains the models on the entire available history, corresponding to an
        expanding window strategy. If `retrain` is set to False, the model must have been fit before. This is not
        supported by all models.

        Parameters
        ----------
        series
            The (or a sequence of) target time series used to successively train and compute the historical forecasts.
        past_covariates
            Optionally, one (or a sequence of) past-observed covariate series. This applies only if the model
            supports past covariates.
        future_covariates
            Optionally, one (or a sequence of) of future-known covariate series. This applies only if the model
            supports future covariates.
        num_samples
            Number of times a prediction is sampled from a probabilistic model. Use values `>1` only for probabilistic
            models.
        train_length
            Number of time steps in our training set (size of backtesting window to train on). Only effective when
            `retrain` is not ``False``. Default is set to `train_length=None` where it takes all available time steps
            up until prediction time, otherwise the moving window strategy is used. If larger than the number of time
            steps available, all steps up until prediction time are used, as in default case. Needs to be at least
            `min_train_series_length`.
        start
            Optionally, the first point in time at which a prediction is computed for a future time.
            This parameter supports: ``float``, ``int`` and ``pandas.Timestamp``, and ``None``.
            If a ``float``, the parameter will be treated as the proportion of the time series
            that should lie before the first prediction point.
            If an ``int``, the parameter will be treated as an integer index to the time index of
            `series` that will be used as first prediction time.
            If a ``pandas.Timestamp``, the time stamp will be used to determine the first prediction time
            directly.
            If ``None``, the first prediction time will automatically be set to:

            - the first predictable point if `retrain` is ``False``, or `retrain` is a Callable and the first
              predictable point is earlier than the first trainable point.
            - the first trainable point if `retrain` is ``True`` or ``int`` (given `train_length`),
              or `retrain` is a Callable and the first trainable point is earlier than the first predictable point.
            - the first trainable point (given `train_length`) otherwise

            Note: Raises a ValueError if `start` yields a time outside the time index of `series`.
            Note: If `start` is outside the possible historical forecasting times, will ignore the parameter
            (default behavior with ``None``) and start at the first trainable/predictable point.
        forecast_horizon
            The forecast horizon for the predictions.
        stride
            The number of time steps between two consecutive predictions.
        retrain
            Whether and/or on which condition to retrain the model before predicting.
            This parameter supports 3 different datatypes: ``bool``, (positive) ``int``, and
            ``Callable`` (returning a ``bool``).
            In the case of ``bool``: retrain the model at each step (`True`), or never retrains the model (`False`).
            In the case of ``int``: the model is retrained every `retrain` iterations.
            In the case of ``Callable``: the model is retrained whenever callable returns `True`.
            The callable must have the following positional arguments:

            - `counter` (int): current `retrain` iteration
            - `pred_time` (pd.Timestamp or int): timestamp of forecast time (end of the training series)
            - `train_series` (TimeSeries): train series up to `pred_time`
            - `past_covariates` (TimeSeries): past_covariates series up to `pred_time`
            - `future_covariates` (TimeSeries): future_covariates series up
              to `min(pred_time + series.freq * forecast_horizon, series.end_time())`

            Note: if any optional `*_covariates` are not passed to `historical_forecast`, ``None`` will be passed
            to the corresponding retrain function argument.
            Note: some models do require being retrained every time and do not support anything other
            than `retrain=True`.
        overlap_end
            Whether the returned forecasts can go beyond the series' end or not.
        last_points_only
            Whether to retain only the last point of each historical forecast.
            If set to True, the method returns a single ``TimeSeries`` containing the successive point forecasts.
            Otherwise, returns a list of historical ``TimeSeries`` forecasts.
        verbose
            Whether to print progress.
        show_warnings
            Whether to show warnings related to historical forecasts optimization, or parameters `start` and
            `train_length`.
        predict_likelihood_parameters
            If set to `True`, the model predict the parameters of its Likelihood parameters instead of the target. Only
            supported for probabilistic models with a likelihood, `num_samples = 1` and `n<=output_chunk_length`.
            Default: ``False``
        enable_optimization
            Whether to use the optimized version of historical_forecasts when supported and available.

        Returns
        -------
        TimeSeries or List[TimeSeries] or List[List[TimeSeries]]
            If `last_points_only` is set to True and a single series is provided in input, a single ``TimeSeries``
            is returned, which contains the historical forecast at the desired horizon.

            A ``List[TimeSeries]`` is returned if either `series` is a ``Sequence`` of ``TimeSeries``,
            or if `last_points_only` is set to False. A list of lists is returned if both conditions are met.
            In this last case, the outer list is over the series provided in the input sequence,
            and the inner lists contain the different historical forecasts.

        """Compute error values that the model would have produced when
        used on (potentially multiple) `series`.

        If `historical_forecasts` are provided, the metric (given by the `metric` function) is evaluated directly on
        the forecast and the actual values. Otherwise, it repeatedly builds a training set: either expanding from the
        beginning  of `series` or moving with a fixed length `train_length`. It trains the current model on the
        training set, emits a forecast of length equal to `forecast_horizon`, and then moves the end of the training
        set forward by `stride` time steps. The metric is then evaluated on the forecast and the actual values.
        Finally, the method returns a `reduction` (the mean by default) of all these metric scores.

        By default, this method uses each historical forecast (whole) to compute error scores.
        If `last_points_only` is set to True, it will use only the last point of each historical
        forecast. In this case, no reduction is used.

        By default, this method always re-trains the models on the entire available history, corresponding to an
        expanding window strategy. If `retrain` is set to False (useful for models for which training might be
        time-consuming, such as deep learning models), the trained model will be used directly to emit the forecasts.

        Parameters
        ----------
        series
            The (or a sequence of) target time series used to successively train and evaluate the historical forecasts.
        past_covariates
            Optionally, one (or a sequence of) past-observed covariate series. This applies only if the model
            supports past covariates.
        future_covariates
            Optionally, one (or a sequence of) future-known covariate series. This applies only if the model
            supports future covariates.
        historical_forecasts
            Optionally, the (or a sequence of) historical forecasts time series to be evaluated. Corresponds to
            the output of :meth:`historical_forecasts() <ForecastingModel.historical_forecasts>`. If provided, will
            skip historical forecasting and ignore all parameters except `series`, `metric`, and `reduction`.
        num_samples
            Number of times a prediction is sampled from a probabilistic model. Use values `>1` only for probabilistic
            models.
        train_length
            Number of time steps in our training set (size of backtesting window to train on). Only effective when
            `retrain` is not ``False``. Default is set to `train_length=None` where it takes all available time steps
            up until prediction time, otherwise the moving window strategy is used. If larger than the number of time
            steps available, all steps up until prediction time are used, as in default case. Needs to be at least
            `min_train_series_length`.
        start
            Optionally, the first point in time at which a prediction is computed for a future time.
            This parameter supports: ``float``, ``int`` and ``pandas.Timestamp``, and ``None``.
            If a ``float``, the parameter will be treated as the proportion of the time series
            that should lie before the first prediction point.
            If an ``int``, the parameter will be treated as an integer index to the time index of
            `series` that will be used as first prediction time.
            If a ``pandas.Timestamp``, the time stamp will be used to determine the first prediction time
            directly.
            If ``None``, the first prediction time will automatically be set to:
                 - the first predictable point if `retrain` is ``False``, or `retrain` is a Callable and the first
                 predictable point is earlier than the first trainable point.

                 - the first trainable point if `retrain` is ``True`` or ``int`` (given `train_length`),
                 or `retrain` is a Callable and the first trainable point is earlier than the first predictable point.

                 - the first trainable point (given `train_length`) otherwise
            Note: Raises a ValueError if `start` yields a time outside the time index of `series`.
            Note: If `start` is outside the possible historical forecasting times, will ignore the parameter
            (default behavior with ``None``) and start at the first trainable/predictable point.
        forecast_horizon
            The forecast horizon for the point predictions.
        stride
            The number of time steps between two consecutive predictions.
        retrain
            Whether and/or on which condition to retrain the model before predicting.
            This parameter supports 3 different datatypes: ``bool``, (positive) ``int``, and
            ``Callable`` (returning a ``bool``).
            In the case of ``bool``: retrain the model at each step (`True`), or never retrains the model (`False`).
            In the case of ``int``: the model is retrained every `retrain` iterations.
            In the case of ``Callable``: the model is retrained whenever callable returns `True`.
            The callable must have the following positional arguments:

                - `counter` (int): current `retrain` iteration
                - `pred_time` (pd.Timestamp or int): timestamp of forecast time (end of the training series)
                - `train_series` (TimeSeries): train series up to `pred_time`
                - `past_covariates` (TimeSeries): past_covariates series up to `pred_time`
                - `future_covariates` (TimeSeries): future_covariates series up
                  to `min(pred_time + series.freq * forecast_horizon, series.end_time())`

            Note: if any optional `*_covariates` are not passed to `historical_forecast`, ``None`` will be passed
            to the corresponding retrain function argument.
            Note: some models do require being retrained every time and do not support anything other
            than `retrain=True`.
        overlap_end
            Whether the returned forecasts can go beyond the series' end or not.
        last_points_only
            Whether to use the whole historical forecasts or only the last point of each forecast to compute the error.
        metric
            A function or a list of function that takes two ``TimeSeries`` instances as inputs and returns an
            error value.
        reduction
            A function used to combine the individual error scores obtained when `last_points_only` is set to False.
            When providing several metric functions, the function will receive the argument `axis = 0` to obtain single
            value for each metric function.
            If explicitly set to `None`, the method will return a list of the individual error scores instead.
            Set to ``np.mean`` by default.
        verbose
            Whether to print progress.
        show_warnings
            Whether to show warnings related to parameters `start`, and `train_length`.

        Returns
        -------
        float or List[float] or List[List[float]]
            The (sequence of) error score on a series, or list of list containing error scores for each
            provided series and each sample.

        Find the best hyper-parameters among a given set using a grid search.

        This function has 3 modes of operation: Expanding window mode, split mode and fitted value mode.
        The three modes of operation evaluate every possible combination of hyper-parameter values
        provided in the `parameters` dictionary by instantiating the `model_class` subclass
        of ForecastingModel with each combination, and returning the best-performing model with regard
        to the `metric` function. The `metric` function is expected to return an error value,
        thus the model resulting in the smallest `metric` output will be chosen.

        The relationship of the training data and test data depends on the mode of operation.

        Expanding window mode (activated when `forecast_horizon` is passed):
        For every hyperparameter combination, the model is repeatedly trained and evaluated on different
        splits of `series`. This process is accomplished by using
        the :func:`backtest` function as a subroutine to produce historic forecasts starting from `start`
        that are compared against the ground truth values of `series`.
        Note that the model is retrained for every single prediction, thus this mode is slower.

        Split window mode (activated when `val_series` is passed):
        This mode will be used when the `val_series` argument is passed.
        For every hyper-parameter combination, the model is trained on `series` and
        evaluated on `val_series`.

        Fitted value mode (activated when `use_fitted_values` is set to `True`):
        For every hyper-parameter combination, the model is trained on `series`
        and evaluated on the resulting fitted values.
        Not all models have fitted values, and this method raises an error if the model doesn't have a `fitted_values`
        member. The fitted values are the result of the fit of the model on `series`. Comparing with the
        fitted values can be a quick way to assess the model, but one cannot see if the model is overfitting the series.

        Derived classes must ensure that a single instance of a model will not share parameters with the other
        instances, e.g., saving models in the same path. Otherwise, an unexpected behavior can arise while running
        several models in parallel (when ``n_jobs != 1``). If this cannot be avoided, then gridsearch
        should be redefined, forcing ``n_jobs = 1``.

        Currently this method only supports deterministic predictions (i.e. when models' predictions
        have only 1 sample).

        Parameters
        ----------
        model_class
            The ForecastingModel subclass to be tuned for 'series'.
        parameters
            A dictionary containing as keys hyperparameter names, and as values lists of values for the
            respective hyperparameter.
        series
            The target series used as input and target for training.
        past_covariates
            Optionally, a past-observed covariate series. This applies only if the model supports past covariates.
        future_covariates
            Optionally, a future-known covariate series. This applies only if the model supports future covariates.
        forecast_horizon
            The integer value of the forecasting horizon. Activates expanding window mode.
        stride
            The number of time steps between two consecutive predictions. Only used in expanding window mode.
        start
            The ``int``, ``float`` or ``pandas.Timestamp`` that represents the starting point in the time index
            of `series` from which predictions will be made to evaluate the model.
            For a detailed description of how the different data types are interpreted, please see the documentation
            for `ForecastingModel.backtest`. Only used in expanding window mode.
        last_points_only
            Whether to use the whole forecasts or only the last point of each forecast to compute the error. Only used
            in expanding window mode.
        show_warnings
            Whether to show warnings related to the `start` parameter. Only used in expanding window mode.
        val_series
            The TimeSeries instance used for validation in split mode. If provided, this series must start right after
            the end of `series`; so that a proper comparison of the forecast can be made.
        use_fitted_values
            If `True`, uses the comparison with the fitted values.
            Raises an error if ``fitted_values`` is not an attribute of `model_class`.
        metric
            A function that takes two TimeSeries instances as inputs (actual and prediction, in this order),
            and returns a float error value.
        reduction
            A reduction function (mapping array to float) describing how to aggregate the errors obtained
            on the different validation series when backtesting. By default it'll compute the mean of errors.
        verbose
            Whether to print progress.
        n_jobs
            The number of jobs to run in parallel. Parallel jobs are created only when there are two or more parameters
            combinations to evaluate. Each job will instantiate, train, and evaluate a different instance of the model.
            Defaults to `1` (sequential). Setting the parameter to `-1` means using all the available cores.
        n_random_samples
            The number/ratio of hyperparameter combinations to select from the full parameter grid. This will perform
            a random search instead of using the full grid.
            If an integer, `n_random_samples` is the number of parameter combinations selected from the full grid and
            must be between `0` and the total number of parameter combinations.
            If a float, `n_random_samples` is the ratio of parameter combinations selected from the full grid and must
            be between `0` and `1`. Defaults to `None`, for which random selection will be ignored.

        Returns
        -------
        ForecastingModel, Dict, float
            A tuple containing an untrained `model_class` instance created from the best-performing hyper-parameters,
            along with a dictionary containing these best hyper-parameters,
            and metric score for the best hyper-parameters.

        This function computes the difference between the actual observations from `series` and the fitted values
