Regression Model Base Class
---------------------------

A regression model predicts values for a time series :math:`Y_t` as a function
of :math:`N` "features" time series :math:`X^i_t`:

.. math:: Y_t = f(X^1_t, ..., X^N_t),

where :math:`t` denotes the time step. Here, the function :math:`f()` is not necessarily linear.
