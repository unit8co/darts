    Applies Dynamic Time Warping to actual_series and pred_series before passing it into the metric.
    Enables comparison between series of different lengths, phases and time indices.

    Defaults to using mae as a metric.

    See darts.dataprocessing.dtw.dtw for more supported parameters.

    Parameters
    ----------
    actual_series
        The (sequence of) actual series.
    pred_series
        The (sequence of) predicted series.
    metric
        The selected metric with signature '[[TimeSeries, TimeSeries], float]' to use. Default: `mae`.
    reduction
        Function taking as input a ``np.ndarray`` and returning a scalar value. This function is used to aggregate
        the metrics of different components in case of multivariate ``TimeSeries`` instances.
    inter_reduction
        Function taking as input a ``np.ndarray`` and returning either a scalar value or a ``np.ndarray``.
        This function can be used to aggregate the metrics of different series in case the metric is evaluated on a
        ``Sequence[TimeSeries]``. Defaults to the identity function, which returns the pairwise metrics for each pair
        of ``TimeSeries`` received in input. Example: ``inter_reduction=np.mean``, will return the average of the
        pairwise metrics.
    n_jobs
        The number of jobs to run in parallel. Parallel jobs are created only when a ``Sequence[TimeSeries]`` is
        passed as input, parallelising operations regarding different ``TimeSeries``. Defaults to `1`
        (sequential). Setting the parameter to `-1` means using all the available processors.
    verbose
        Optionally, whether to print operations progress

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Result of calling metric(warped_series1, warped_series2)

    """:math:`\\rho`-risk (rho-risk or quantile risk).

    Given a time series of actual values :math:`y_t` of length :math:`T` and a time series of stochastic predictions
    (containing N samples) :math:`\\hat{y}_t` of shape :math:`T \\times N`, rho-risk is a metric that quantifies the
    accuracy of a specific quantile :math:`\\rho` from the predicted value distribution.

    For a univariate stochastic predicted TimeSeries the :math:`\\rho`-risk is given by:

    .. math:: \\frac{ L_{\\rho} \\left( Z, \\hat{Z}_{\\rho} \\right) } {Z},

    where :math:`L_{\\rho} \\left( Z, \\hat{Z}_{\\rho} \\right)` is the :math:`\\rho`-loss function:

    .. math:: L_{\\rho} \\left( Z, \\hat{Z}_{\\rho} \\right) = 2 \\left( Z - \\hat{Z}_{\\rho} \\right)
        \\left( \\rho I_{\\hat{Z}_{\\rho} < Z} - \\left( 1 - \\rho \\right) I_{\\hat{Z}_{\\rho} \\geq Z} \\right),

    where :math:`Z = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} y_t` (1) is the aggregated target value and :math:`\\hat{Z}_{\\rho}` is the
    :math:`\\rho`-quantile of the predicted values. For this, each sample realization :math:`i \\in N` is first
    aggregated over the time span similar to (1) with :math:`\\hat{Z}_{i} = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\hat{y}_{i,t}`.

    :math:`I_{cond} = 1` if cond is True else :math:`0``

    Parameters
    ----------
    actual_series
        The (sequence of) actual series.
    pred_series
        The (sequence of) predicted series.
    rho
        The quantile (float [0, 1]) of interest for the risk evaluation.
    intersect
        For time series that are overlapping in time without having the same time index, setting `True`
        will consider the values only over their common time interval (intersection in time).
    reduction
        Function taking as input a ``np.ndarray`` and returning a scalar value. This function is used to aggregate
        the metrics of different components in case of multivariate ``TimeSeries`` instances.
    inter_reduction
        Function taking as input a ``np.ndarray`` and returning either a scalar value or a ``np.ndarray``.
        This function can be used to aggregate the metrics of different series in case the metric is evaluated on a
        ``Sequence[TimeSeries]``. Defaults to the identity function, which returns the pairwise metrics for each pair
        of ``TimeSeries`` received in input. Example: ``inter_reduction=np.mean``, will return the average of the
