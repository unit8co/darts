    """ A function for backtesting `ForecastingModel`'s.

    This function computes the time series of historical predictions
    that would have been obtained, if `model` had been used to predict `series`
    with a certain time horizon.

    To this end, it repeatedly builds a training set from the beginning of `series`.
    It trains `model` on the training set, emits a (point) prediction for a fixed
    forecast horizon, and then moves the end of the training set forward by one
    time step. The resulting predictions are then returned.

    This always re-trains the models on the entire available history,
    corresponding an expending window strategy.

    Parameters
    ----------
    series
        The time series on which to backtest
    model
        The forecasting model to be backtested
    start

    fcast_horizon_n
        The forecast horizon for the point predictions
    trim_to_series
        Whether the predicted series has the end trimmed to match the end of the main series
    verbose

    Returns
    -------
    TimeSeries
        A time series containing the forecast values for `series`, when successively applying
        the specified model with the specified forecast horizon.

    """ A function for computing the residuals produced by a given model and time series.

    This function computes the difference between the actual observations from `series`
    and the fitted values vector p obtained by training `model` on `series`.

    For every index i in `series`, p[i] is computed by training `model` on
    series[:(i - `fcast_horizon_n`)] and forecasting `fcast_horizon_n` into the future.
    (p[i] will be set to the last value of the predicted vector.)
    The vector of residuals will be shorter than `series` due to the minimum
    training series length required by `model` and the gap introduced by `fcast_horizon_n`.

    Note that the common usage of the term residuals implies a value for `fcast_horizon_n` of 1.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model
        Instance of ForecastingModel used to compute the fitted values p.
    series
        The TimeSeries instance which the residuals will be computed for.
    fcast_horizon_n
        The forecasting horizon used to predict each fitted value.
    verbose
        Whether to print progress.

    Returns
    -------
    TimeSeries
        The vector of residuals.
