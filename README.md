# u8timeseries

## macOS install:

The install happens with `pip`. For `conda` users, do the following first:
```
conda install gcc
conda install -c conda-forge fbprophet
```

Next, from the root of u8timeseries:
```
pip install .
```

If Fortran is not installed on the device, the following error message might be printed during the installation:

```
error: library dfftpack has Fortran sources but no Fortran compiler found
```
This can be solved by installing gcc using Homebrew:
```
brew install gcc
```

## docker install

Build and run the docker using the following two commands:
```
./build_docker.sh
./run_docker.sh
```
Then copy and paste the URL provided by the docker container into your browser to access jupyter notebook.

## Usage
For now the best documentation is examples.
See: https://github.com/unit8co/u8timeseries/blob/master/examples/Air-passengers-example.ipynb

## Issue with Prophet and Pandas
If you encounter the following error when trying to plot a `TimeSeries`:
```
float() argument must be a string or a number, not 'Period
```
this is likely because [Prophet deregisters the Pandas converters in its code](https://darektidwell.com/typeerror-float-argument-must-be-a-string-or-a-number-not-period-facebook-prophet-and-pandas/). To fix it, just call
```
pd.plotting.register_matplotlib_converters()
```
