**darts** is a python library for easy manipulation and forecasting of time series.
It contains a variety of models, from classics such as ARIMA to neural networks.
The models can all be used in the same way, using `fit()` and `predict()` functions,
similar to scikit-learn. The library also makes it easy to backtest models,
and combine the predictions of several models and external regressors.

## Install

We recommend to first setup a clean python environment for your project with at least python 3.6 using your favorite tool ([conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html "conda-env"), [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) with or without [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)).

### Quick Install

Once your environement is setup you can install darts using the pip package:

    pip install u8darts

### Step-by-step Install

For more detailed install instructions you can refer to our installation guide at the end of this page.

## Example Usage

Create `TimeSeries` object from a Pandas DataFrame, and split in train/validation series:

```python
import pandas as pd
from darts import TimeSeries

df = pd.read_csv('AirPassengers.csv', delimiter=",")
series = TimeSeries.from_dataframe(df, 'Month', '#Passengers')
train, val = series.split_after(pd.Timestamp('19590101'))
```

>The dataset used in this example can be downloaded from this [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unit8co/darts/master/examples/AirPassengers.csv).

Fit an exponential smoothing model, and make a prediction over the validation series' duration:

```python
from darts.models import ExponentialSmoothing

model = ExponentialSmoothing()
model.fit(train)
prediction = model.predict(len(val))
```

Plot:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

series.plot(label='actual', lw=3)
prediction.plot(label='forecast', lw=3)
plt.legend()
plt.xlabel('Year')
```

</div>

We invite you to go over the example notebooks in the `examples` directory.

## Documentation

The documentation of the API and models is available [here](https://unit8co.github.io/darts/).

## Features

Currently, the library contains the following features: 

**Forecasting Models:**

* Exponential smoothing,
* ARIMA & auto-ARIMA,
* Facebook Prophet,
* Theta method,
* FFT (Fast Fourier Transform),
* Recurrent neural networks (vanilla RNNs, GRU, and LSTM variants),
* Temporal convolutional network.

**Preprocessing:** Transformer tool for easily scaling / normalizing time series.

**Metrics:** A variety of metrics for evaluating time series' goodness of fit; 
from R2-scores to Mean Absolute Scaled Error.

**Backtesting:** Utilities for simulating historical forecasts, using moving time windows.

**Regressive Models:** Possibility to predict a time series from several other time series 
(e.g., external regressors), using arbitrary regressive models.

**Multivariate Support:** Tools to create, manipulate and forecast multivariate time series.

## Contribute

The development is ongoing, and there are many new features that we want to add. 
We welcome pull requests and issues on github.

Before working on a contribution (a new feature or a fix) make sure you can't find anything related in [issues](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/issues). If there is no on-going effort on what you plan to do then we recommend to do the following:

1. Create an issue, describe how you would attempt to solve it, and if possible wait for a discussion.
2. Fork the repository.
3. Clone the forked repository locally.
4. Create a clean python env and install requirements with pip: `pip install -r requirements/main.txt -r requirements/dev.txt -r requirements/release.txt`
5. Create a new branch with your fix / feature from the **develop** branch.
6. Create a pull request from your new branch to the **develop** branch.

## Installation Guide

### Preconditions

Our direct dependencies include `fbprophet` and `torch` which have non-Python dependencies.
A Conda environment is thus recommended because it will handle all of those in one go.

The following steps assume running inside a conda environment. 
If that's not possible, first follow the official instructions to install 
[fbprophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/installation.html#python)
and [torch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/), then skip to 
[Install darts](#install-darts)

To create a conda environment for Python 3.7
(after installing [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)):

    conda create --name <env-name> python=3.7

Don't forget to activate your virtual environment

    conda activate <env-name>


### MAC

    conda install -c conda-forge -c pytorch pip fbprophet pytorch

### Linux and Windows

    conda install -c conda-forge -c pytorch pip fbprophet pytorch cpuonly

### Install darts

    pip install u8darts

### Running the examples only, without installing:

If the conda setup is causing too many problems, we also provide a Docker image with everything set up for you and ready-to-use python notebooks with demo examples.
To run the example notebooks without installing our libraries natively on your machine, you can use our Docker image:
```bash
./gradlew docker && ./gradlew dockerRun
```

Then copy and paste the URL provided by the docker container into your browser to access Jupyter notebook.

For this setup to work you need to have a Docker service installed. You can get it at [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

### Tests

Gradle setup works best with python env, but it requires only that pip is for python3.

To run all tests at once just run
```bash
./gradlew test
```

alternatively you can run
```bash
./gradlew unitTest     # to run only unittests
./gradlew coverageTest # to run coverage
./gradlew lint         # to run linter
```

### Documentation

To build documantation locally just run
```bash
./gradlew buildDocs
```
After that docs will be available in `./docs/build/html` directory. You can just open `./docs/build/html/index.html` using your favourite browser.
