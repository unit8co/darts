    """ A function for backtesting `ForecastingModel`'s.

    This function computes the time series of historical predictions
    that would have been obtained, if `model` had been used to predict `series`
    with a certain time horizon.

    To this end, it repeatedly builds a training set from the beginning of `series`.
    It trains `model` on the training set, emits a (point) prediction for a fixed
    forecast horizon, and then moves the end of the training set forward by one
    time step. The resulting predictions are then returned.

    This always re-trains the models on the entire available history,
    corresponding an expending window strategy.

    Parameters
    ----------
    series
        The time series on which to backtest
    model
        The forecasting model to be backtested
    start
        The first prediction time, at which a prediction is computed for a future time
    fcast_horizon_n
        The forecast horizon for the point predictions
    trim_to_series
        Whether the predicted series has the end trimmed to match the end of the main series
    verbose
        Whether to print progress

    Returns
    -------
    TimeSeries
        A time series containing the forecast values for `series`, when successively applying
        the specified model with the specified forecast horizon.

    """ A function for backtesting `RegressionModel`'s.

    This function computes the time series of historical predictions
    that would have been obtained, if the `model` had been used to predict `series`
    using the `feature_series`, with a certain time horizon.

    To this end, it repeatedly builds a training set composed of both features and targets,
    from `feature_series` and `target_series`, respectively.
    It trains `model` on the training set, emits a (point) prediction for a fixed
    forecast horizon, and then moves the end of the training set forward by one
    time step. The resulting predictions are then returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    feature_series
        A list of time series representing the features for the regression model (independent variables)
    target_series
        The target time series for the regression model (dependent variable)
    model
        The regression model to be backtested
    start
        The first prediction time, at which a prediction is computed for a future time
