# Changelog

Darts is still in an early development phase and we cannot always guarantee backwards compatibility. Changes that may **break code which uses a previous release of Darts** are marked with a "&#x1F534;".

## [Unreleased](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/tree/develop)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/compare/0.4.0...develop)
### For users of the library
**Added:**
- New `ForecastingModel.backtest()` and `RegressionModel.backtest()` functions which by default compute a single error score from the historical forecasts the model would have produced.
  - A new `reduction` parameter allows to specify whether to compute the mean/median/… of errors or (when `reduction` is set to `None`) to return a list of historical errors.
  - The previous `backtest()` functionality still exists but has been renamed `historical_forecasts()`
- Added a new `last_points_only` parameter to `historical_forecasts()`, `backtest()` and `gridsearch()`

**Changed:**
- &#x1F534; Renamed `backtest()` into `historical_forecasts()`

**Fixed:**
- Small mistake in the `NaiveDrift` model implementation which caused the first predicted value to repeat the last training value.

### For users of the library:
**Changed:**
- `fill_missing_values()` and `MissingValuesFiller` used to remove the variable names when used with `fill='auto'` – not anymore.

## [0.4.0](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/tree/0.4.0) (2020-10-28)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/compare/0.3.0...0.4.0)

### For users of the library:
**Added:**
- Data (pre) processing abilities using `DataTransformer`, `Pipeline`:
  - `DataTransformer` provide a unified interface to apply transformations on `TimeSeries`, using their `transform()` method
  - `Pipeline`:
    - allow chaining of `DataTransformers`
    - provide `fit()`, `transform()`, `fit_transform()` and `inverse_transform()` methods.
  - Implementing your own data transformers:
    - Data transformers which need to be fitted first should derive from the `FittableDataTransformer` base class and implement a `fit()` method. Fittable transformers also provide a `fit_transform()` method, which fits the transformer and then transforms the data with a single call.
    - Data transformers which perform an invertible transformation should derive from the `InvertibleDataTransformer` base class and implement a `inverse_transform()` method.
    - Data transformers wich are neither fittable nor invertible should derive from the `BaseDataTransformer` base class
    - All data transformers must implement a `transform()` method.
- Concrete `DataTransformer` implementations:
  - `MissingValuesFiller` wraps around `fill_missing_value()` and allows to fill missing values using either a constant value or the `pd.interpolate()` method.
  - `Mapper` and `InvertibleMapper` allow to easily perform the equivalent of a `map()` function on a TimeSeries, and can be made part of a `Pipeline`
  - `BoxCox` allows to apply a BoxCox transformation to the data
- Extended `map()` on `TimeSeries` to accept functions which use both a value and its timestamp to compute a new value e.g.`f(timestamp, datapoint) = new_datapoint`
- Two new forecasting models:
  - `TransformerModel`, an implementation based on the architecture described in [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) by Vaswani et al. (2017)
  - `NBEATSModel`, an implementation based on the N-BEATS architecture described in [N-BEATS: Neural basis expansion analysis for interpretable time series forecasting](https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1ecqn4YwB) by Boris N. Oreshkin et al. (2019)

**Changed:**
- &#x1F534; Removed `cols` parameter from `map()`. Using indexing on `TimeSeries` is preferred.
  ```python
  # Assuming a multivariate TimeSeries named series with 3 columns or variables.
  # To apply fn to columns with names '0' and '2':

  #old syntax
  series.map(fn, cols=['0', '2']) # returned a time series with 3 columns
  #new syntax
  series[['0', '2']].map(fn) # returns a time series with only 2 columns
  ```
- &#x1F534; Renamed `ScalerWrapper` into `Scaler`
- &#x1F534; Renamed the `preprocessing` module into `dataprocessing`
- &#x1F534; Unified `auto_fillna()` and `fillna()` into a single `fill_missing_value()` function
  ```python
  #old syntax
  fillna(series, fill=0)

  #new syntax
  fill_missing_values(series, fill=0)

  #old syntax
  auto_fillna(series, **interpolate_kwargs)

  #new syntax
  fill_missing_values(series, fill='auto', **interpolate_kwargs)
  fill_missing_values(series, **interpolate_kwargs) # fill='auto' by default
  ```

### For developers of the library
### Changed
- GitHub release workflow is now triggered manually from the GitHub "Actions" tab in the repository, providing a `#major`, `#minor`, or `#patch` argument. [\#211](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/211)
- (A limited number of) notebook examples are now run as part of the GitHub develop workflow.

## [0.3.0](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/tree/0.3.0) (2020-10-05)

  - Moved backtesting functionalities inside `ForecastingModel` and `RegressionModel`
    ```python
    # old syntax:
    backtest_forecasting(forecasting_model, *args, **kwargs)

    # new syntax:
    forecasting_model.backtest(*args, **kwargs)

    # old syntax:
    backtest_regression(regression_model, *args, **kwargs)

    # new syntax:
    regression_model.backtest(*args, **kwargs)
    ```

- &#x1F534; `ForecastingModel` `fit()` **method syntax** using TimeSeries indexing instead of additional parameters [\#161](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/161)
  ```python
  # old syntax:
  multivariate_model.fit(multivariate_series, target_indices=[0, 1])

  # new syntax:
  multivariate_model.fit(multivariate_series, multivariate_series[["0", "1"]])

  # old syntax:
  univariate_model.fit(multivariate_series, component_index=2)

  # new syntax:
  univariate_model.fit(multivariate_series["2"])
